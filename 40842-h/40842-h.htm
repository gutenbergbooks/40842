<p>Leading superintendents of schools and teachers
have been pointing out that in "Wild Life Near
Home," by Dallas Lore Sharp, there is much
valuable supplementary reading for schools, and
no less an authority than Mr. John Burroughs,
in his recent article in the "Atlantic Monthly"
entitled "Real and Sham Natural History,"
made the statement that "of all the nature
books of recent years, I look upon Mr. Sharp's
as the best."</p>

<p>The present volume will be found to contain
carefully selected chapters from "Wild Life,"
arranged with special reference to nature study
in the schools, where it is hoped that it will become
popular with both teachers and pupils.</p>

<h2><a name="BIRDS_WINTER_BEDS" id="BIRDS_WINTER_BEDS"></a>BIRDS' WINTER BEDS</h2>

<p class="center">The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold.</p>


<p>A storm had been raging from the northeast
all day. Toward evening the wind
strengthened to a gale, and the fine, icy snow
swirled and drifted over the frozen fields.</p>

<p>I lay a long time listening to the wild symphony
of the winds, thankful for the roof over
my head, and wondering how the hungry, homeless
creatures out of doors would pass the night.
Where do the birds sleep such nights as this?
Where in this bitter cold, this darkness and
storm, will they make their beds? The lark
that broke from the snow at my feet as I crossed
the pasture this afternoon&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i4">What comes o' thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whar wilt thou cow'r thy chittering wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">An' close thy e'e?<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The storm grew fiercer; the wind roared
through the big pines by the side of the house
and swept hoarsely on across the fields; the
pines shivered and groaned, and their long
limbs scraped over the shingles above me as if
feeling with frozen fingers for a way in; the
windows rattled, the cracks and corners of the
old farm-house shrieked, and a long, thin line of
snow sifted in from beneath the window across
the garret floor. I fancied these sounds of the
storm were the voices of freezing birds, crying
to be taken in from the cold. Once I thought
I heard a thud against the window, a sound
heavier than the rattle of the snow. Something
seemed to be beating at the glass. It might be
a bird. I got out of bed to look; but there
was only the ghostly face of the snow pressed
against the panes, half-way to the window's top.
I imagined that I heard the thud again; but,
while listening, fell asleep and dreamed that
my window was frozen fast, and that all the
birds in the world were knocking at it, trying
to get in out of the night and storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>The fields lay pure and white and flooded with
sunshine when I awoke. Jumping out of bed,
I ran to the window, and saw a dark object on
the sill outside. I raised the sash, and there,
close against the glass, were two quails&mdash;frozen
stiff in the snow. It was they I heard the
night before fluttering at the window. The
ground had been covered deep with snow for
several days, and at last, driven by hunger and
cold from the fields, they saw my light, and
sought shelter from the storm and a bed for
the night with me.</p>

<p>Four others, evidently of the same covey,
spent the night in the wagon-house, and in the
morning helped themselves fearlessly to the
chickens' breakfast. They roosted with the
chickens several nights, but took to the fields
again as soon as the snow began to melt.</p>

<p>It is easy to account for our winter birds during
the day. Along near noon, when it is warm
and bright, you will find the sparrows, chickadees,
and goldfinches searching busily among
the bushes and weeds for food, and the crows
and jays scouring the fields. But what about
them during the dark? Where do they pass
the long winter nights?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>Why, they have nests, you say. Yes, they <i>had</i>
nests in the summer, and then, perhaps, one of
the parent birds may be said to have slept in the
nest during the weeks of incubation and rearing
of the young. But nests are cradles, not beds,
and are never used by even the young birds from
the day they leave them. Muskrats build houses,
foxes have holes, and squirrels sleep in true nests;
but of the birds it can be said, "they have not
where to lay their heads." They sleep upon
their feet in the grass, in hollow trees, and among
the branches; but, at best, such a bed is no more
than a roost. A large part of the year this roost
is new every night, so that the question of a
sleeping-place during the winter is most serious.</p>

<p>The cheerful little goldfinches, that bend the
dried ragweeds and grass-stalks down and scatter
their chaff over the snow, sleep in the thick
cedars and pines. These warm, close-limbed
evergreens I have found to be the lodging-houses
of many of the smaller winter birds&mdash;the fox-colored
sparrow, snowbird, crossbill, and sometimes
of the chickadee, though he usually tucks
his little black cap under his wing in a woodpecker's
hole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i004.jpg" width="400" height="512" alt="cheerful little goldfinches" title="cheerful little goldfinches" />
<span class="caption">&quot;The cheerful little goldfinches,
that bend the dried
ragweeds.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The meadow-larks always
roost upon the ground. They
creep well under the grass, or, if
the wind is high and it snows, they
squat close to the ground behind a
tuft of grass or thick bush and sleep
while the cold white flakes fall about
them. They are often covered before the morning;
and when housed thus from the wind and
hidden from prowling enemies, no bird could
wish for a cozier, warmer, safer bed.</p>

<p>But what a lonely bed it is! Nothing seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
so utterly homeless and solitary as a meadow-lark
after the winter nightfall. In the middle
of a wide, snow-covered pasture one will occasionally
spring from under your feet, scattering
the snow that covered him, and go whirring
away through the dusk, lost instantly in the
darkness&mdash;a single little life in the wild, bleak
wilderness of winter fields!</p>

<p>Again, the grass is often a dangerous bed. On
the day before the great March blizzard of 1888,
the larks were whistling merrily from the fences,
with just a touch of spring in their call. At
noon I noted no signs of storm, but by four
o'clock&mdash;an hour earlier than usual&mdash;the larks
had disappeared. They rose here and there
from the grass as I crossed the fields, not as they
do when feeding, far ahead of me, but close to
my feet. They had gone to bed. By early evening
the snow began to fall, and for two days
continued furiously.</p>

<p>A week later, when the deep drifts melted, I
found several larks that had perished from cold
or starvation or had smothered under the
weight of snow.</p>

<p>There is something of awe in the thought of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
bird nestling close beneath a snow-laden bush in
a broad meadow, or clinging fast to a limb in
the swaying top of some tall tree, rocked in its
great arms through the night by a winter gale.
All trees, even the pines and cedars, are fearfully
exposed sleeping-places, and death from cold is
not infrequent among the birds that take beds
in them.</p>

<p>The pine barrens, and especially certain pine
clumps along Cohansey Creek and at the head
of Cubby Hollow, used to be famous crow-roosts.
Thousands of the birds, a few years ago, frequented
these pieces of wood in the winter.
About the middle of the afternoon, during the
severest weather, they begin to fly over to the
roost at the head of the Hollow, coming in from
the surrounding fields, some of them from miles
away, where they have been foraging all day
for food. You can tell the character of the
weather by the manner of their flight. In the
fall and spring they went over cawing, chasing
each other and performing in the air; they were
happy, and life was as abundant as the spring
promise or the autumn fullness everywhere. But
in January the land is bare and hard, and life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
correspondingly lean and cheerless. You see it
in their heavy, dispirited flight; all their spring
joyousness is gone; they pass over silent and
somber, reluctant to leave the fields, and fearful
of the night. There is not a croak as they settle
among the pines&mdash;scores, sometimes hundreds of
them, in a single tree.</p>

<p>Here, in the swaying tops, amid the heavy
roar of the winds, they sleep. You need have
no fear of waking them as you steal through the
shadows beneath the trees. The thick mat of
needles or the sifted snow muffles your footfalls;
and the winds still the breaking branches and
snapping twigs. What a bed in a winter storm!
The sky is just light enough for you to distinguish
the dim outlines of the sleepers as they rock in
the waves of the dark green that rise and fall
above you; the trees moan, the branches shiver
and creak, and high above all, around and beneath
you, filling the recesses of the dark wood
rolls the volume of the storm.</p>

<p>But the crows sleep on, however high the
winds. They sit close to the branches, that the
feathers may cover their clinging feet; they
tuck their heads beneath their wing-coverts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
thus protecting the whole body, except one
side of the head, which the feathers of the wing
cannot quite shelter. This leaves an eye exposed,
and this eye, like the heel of Achilles,
proves to be the one vulnerable spot. It freezes
in very severe weather, causing a slow, painful
death. In the morning, after an unusually cold
night, you can find dozens of crows flapping
piteously about in the trees of the roost and
upon the ground, with frozen eyes. In January,
1895, I saw very many of them along the
Hollow, blind in one eye or in both eyes, dying
of pain and starvation. It was pitiful to see
their sufferings. The snow in places was
sprinkled with their broken feathers, and with
pine-needles which they had plucked off and
tried to eat. Nothing could be done for the
poor things. I have tried time and again to
doctor them; but they were sure to die in the
end.</p>

<p>Who has not wondered, as he has seen the
red rim of the sun sink down in the sea, where
the little brood of Mother Carey's chickens
skimming round the vessel would sleep that
night? Or who, as he hears the <i>honking</i> of geese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
overhead in the darkness, has not questioned by
what</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i10">... plashy brink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or where the rocking billows rise and sink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the chafed ocean-side,<br /></span>
</div>

<p>they will find rest?</p>

<p>In winter, when a heavy southeast wind is
blowing, the tides of Delaware Bay are high and
the waters very rough. Then the ducks that
feed along the reedy flats of the bay are driven
into the quieter water of the creeks, and at
night fly into the marshes, where they find safe
beds in the "salt-holes."</p>

<p>The salt-holes are sheets of water having no
outlet, with clean perpendicular sides as if cut
out of the grassy marsh, varying in size from a
few feet wide to an acre in extent. The sedges
grow luxuriantly around their margins, making
a thick, low wall in winter, against which the
winds blow in vain. If a bird must sleep in the
water, such a hole comes as near to being a perfect
cradle as anything could be, short of the
bottom of a well.</p>

<p>The ducks come in soon after dark. You
can hear the whistle of their wings as they pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
just above your head, skimming along the
marsh. They settle in a hole, swim close up to the
windward shore, beneath the sedges, and, with
their heads under their wings, go fast asleep.
And as they sleep the ice begins to form&mdash;first,
along their side of the hole, where the water is
calmest; then, extending out around them, it
becomes a hard sheet across the surface.</p>

<p>A night that will freeze a salt-hole is not one
in which there is likely to be much hunting
done by man or beast. But I have been on the
marshes such nights, and so have smaller and
more justified hunters. It is not a difficult feat
to surprise the sleeping ducks. The ice is half
an inch thick when you come up, and seals the
hole completely, save immediately about the
bodies of the birds. Their first impulse, when
taken thus at close range, is to dive; and down
they go, turning in their tracks.</p>

<p>Will they get out? One may chance to
strike the hole which his warm body kept
open, as he rises to breathe; but it is more
likely that he will come up under the ice, and
drown. I have occasionally found a dead duck
beneath the ice or floating in the water of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
salt-hole. It had been surprised, no doubt,
while sleeping, and, diving in fright, was
drowned under the ice, which had silently
spread like a strange, dreadful covering over
its bed.</p>

<p>Probably the life of no other of our winter
birds is so full of hardship as is that of the
quail, Bob White.</p>

<p>In the early summer the quails are hatched
in broods of from ten to twenty, and live as
families until the pairing season the next spring.
The chicks keep close to the neighborhood of
the home nest, feeding and roosting together,
under the guidance of the parent birds. But
this happy union is soon broken by the advent
of the gunning season. It is seldom that a bevy
escapes this period whole and uninjured. Indeed,
if <i>one</i> of the brood is left to welcome the
spring it is little less than a miracle.</p>

<p>I have often heard the scattered, frightened
families called together after a day of hard
shooting; and once, in the old pasture to the
north of Cubby Hollow, I saw the bevy assemble.</p>

<p>It was long after sunset, but the snow so diffused
the light that I could see pretty well. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
climbing the fence into the pasture,
I had started a rabbit, and was creeping
up behind a low cedar, when a quail,
very near me, whistled softly, <i>Whirl-ee!</i> The
cedar was between us. <i>Whirl-ee, whirl-ee-gig!</i>
she whistled again.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;There she stood in the
snow with head high,
listening anxiously.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>It was the sweetest bird-note I ever heard,
being so low, so liquid, so mellow that I almost
doubted if Bob White could make it. But there
she stood in the snow with head high, listening
anxiously. Again she whistled, louder this time;
and from the woods below came a faint answering
call: <i>White!</i> The answer seemed to break
a spell; and on three sides of me sounded
other calls. At this the little signaler repeated
her efforts, and each time the answers came
louder and nearer. Presently something dark
hurried by me over the snow and joined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
quail I was watching. It was one of the covey
that I had heard call from the woods.</p>

<p>Again and again the signal was sent forth
until a third, fourth, and finally a fifth were
grouped about the leader. There was just an
audible twitter of welcome and gratitude exchanged
as each new-comer made his appearance.
Once more the whistle sounded; but this time
there was no response across the silent field.</p>

<p>The quails made their way to a thick cedar
that spread out over the ground, and, huddling
together in a close bunch under this, they murmured
something soft and low among themselves
and&mdash;dreamed.</p>

<p>Some of the family were evidently missing,
and I crept away, sorry that even one had been
taken from the little brood.</p>

<h2><a name="SOME_SNUG_WINTER_BEDS" id="SOME_SNUG_WINTER_BEDS"></a>SOME SNUG WINTER BEDS</h2>



<p>It was a cold, desolate January day. Scarcely
a sprig of green showed in the wide landscape,
except where the pines stood in a long
blur against the gray sky. There was not a sign
that anything living remained in the snow-buried
fields, nor in the empty woods, shivering and
looking all the more uncovered and cold under
their mantle of snow, until a solitary crow
flapped heavily over toward the pines in search
of an early bed for the night.</p>

<p>The bird reminded me that I, too, should be
turning toward the pines; for the dull gray
afternoon was thickening into night, and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
bed lay beyond the woods, a long tramp through
the snow.</p>

<p>As the black creature grew small in the distance
and vanished among the trees, I felt a
pang of pity for him. I knew by his flight that
he was hungry and weary and cold. Every
labored stroke of his unsteady wings told of a
long struggle with the winter death. He was
silent; and his muteness spoke the foreboding
and dread with which he faced another bitter
night in the pines.</p>

<p>The snow was half-way to my knees; and still
another storm was brewing. All day the leaden
sky had been closing in, weighed down by the
snow-filled air. That hush which so often precedes
the severest winter storms brooded everywhere.
The winds were in leash&mdash;no, not in
leash; for had my ears been as keen as those of
the creatures about me, I might even now have
heard them baying far away to the north. It
was not the winds that were still; it was the
fields and forests that quailed before the onset
of the storm.</p>

<p>I skirted Lupton's Pond and saw the muskrat
village, a collection of white mounds out in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ice, and coming on to Cubby Hollow, I crossed on
the ice, ascended the hill, and keeping in the
edge of the swamp, left the pines a distance to
the left. A chickadee, as if oppressed by the
silence and loneliness among the trees, and uneasy
in his stout little heart at the threatening
storm, flew into the bushes as near to me as he
could get, and, apparently for the sake of companionship,
followed me along the path, cheeping
plaintively.</p>

<p>As I emerged from the woods into a cornfield
and turned to look over at the gloomy
pines, a snowflake fell softly upon my arm. The
storm had begun. Now the half-starved crows
came flocking in by hundreds, hurrying to roost
before the darkness should overtake them. A
biting wind was rising; already I could hear it
soughing through the pines. There was something
fascinating in the oncoming monster, and
backing up behind a corn-shock, I stopped a
little to watch the sweep of its white winds between
me and the dark, sounding pines.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i008.jpg" width="400" height="243" alt="icy flakes fell" title="icy flakes fell" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I shivered as the icy flakes fell thicker and faster.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>I shivered as the icy flakes fell thicker and
faster. How the wild, unhoused things must
suffer to-night! I thought, as the weary procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of crows beat on toward the trees.
Presently there was a small stir within the
corn-shock. I laid my ear to the stalks and
listened. Mice! I could hear them moving
around in there. It was with relief that I felt
that here, at least, was a little people whom
the cold and night could not hurt.</p>

<p>These mice were as warmly sheltered inside
this great shock as I should be in my furnace-warmed
home. Their tiny nests of corn-silk,
hidden away, perhaps, within the stiff, empty
husks at the shock's very center, could never
be wet by a drop of the most driving rain nor
reached by the most searching frosts. And not
a mouse of them feared starvation. A plenty
of nubbins had been left from the husking, and
they would have corn for the shelling far into the
spring&mdash;if the fodder and their homes should be
left to them so long.</p>

<p>I floundered on toward home. In the gathering
night, amid the swirl of the snow, the
shocks seemed like spectral tents pitched up
and down some ghostly camp. But the specters
and ghosts were all with me, all out in the
whirling storm. The mice knew nothing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
wandering, shivering spirits; they nibbled their
corn and squeaked in snug contentment; for
only dreams of the winter come to them in
there.</p>

<p>These shock-dwellers were the common house-mice,
<i>Mus musculus</i>. But they are not the only
mice that have warm beds in winter. In fact,
bed-making is a specialty among the mice.</p>

<p><i>Zapus</i>, the jumping-mouse, the exquisite little
fellow with the long tail and kangaroo legs, has
made his nest of leaves and grass down in the
ground, where he lies in a tiny ball just out of
the frost's reach, fast asleep. He will be plowed
out of bed next spring, if his nest is in a field
destined for corn or melons; for <i>Zapus</i> is sure
to oversleep. He is a very sound sleeper. The
bluebirds, robins, and song-sparrows will have
been back for weeks, the fields will be turning
green, and as for the flowers, there will be a
long procession of them started, before this
pretty sleepy-head rubs his eyes, uncurls himself,
and digs his way out to see the new spring
morning.</p>

<p>Does this winter-long sleep seem to him only
as a nap overnight?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="300" height="329" alt="The meadow-mouse." title="The meadow-mouse." />
<span class="caption">The meadow-mouse.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Arvicola</i>, the meadow-mouse, that duck-legged,
stump-tailed, pot-bellied mouse whose paths
you see everywhere in the meadows and fields,
stays wide awake all winter. He is not so tender
as <i>Zapus</i>. The cold does not bother him;
he likes it. Up he comes from his underground
nest,&mdash;or home, rather, for it is more than a
mere sleeping-place,&mdash;and runs out into the
snow like a boy. He dives and plunges about
in the soft white drifts, plowing out roads that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
crisscross and loop and lady's-chain and lead
nowhere&mdash;simply for the fun of it.</p>

<p>Fairies do wonderful things and live in impossible
castles; but no fairy ever had a palace
in fairy-land more impossible than this unfairy-like
meadow-mouse had in my back yard.</p>

<p>One February day I broke through the frozen
crust of earth in the garden and opened a large
pit in which forty bushels of beets were buried.
I took out the beets, and, when near the bottom,
I came upon a narrow tunnel running around
the wall of the pit like the Whispering Gallery
around the dome of St. Paul's. It completely
circled the pit, was well traveled, and, without
doubt, was the corridor of some small animal
that had the great beet-pit for a winter home.</p>

<p>There were numerous dark galleries branching
off from this main hallway, piercing out
into the ground. Into one of these I put my
finger, by way of discovery, thinking I might
find the nest. I did find the nest&mdash;and more.
The instant my finger entered the hole a sharp
twinge shot up my arm, and I snatched away
my hand with a large meadow-mouse fastened
to the end of my finger, and clinging desperately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to her, lo! two baby mice, little bigger than
thimbles.</p>

<p>In this mild and even temperature, four feet
below the frozen surface of the garden, with
never a care as to weather and provisions, dwelt
this single family of meadow-mice. What a
home it was! A mansion, indeed, with rooms
innumerable, and a main hall girdling a very
mountain of juicy, sugary beets. This family
could not complain of hard times. Besides the
beets, the mice had harvested for themselves a
number of cribs of clover-roots. These cribs, or
bins, were in the shape of little pockets in the
walls of the great gallery. Each contained a
cupful of the thick, meaty tap-roots of clover,
cut into lengths of about half an inch. If the
beets should fail (!), or cloy upon them, they
had the roots to fall back on.</p>

<p>It was absolutely dark here, and worse; there
was no way to get fresh air that I could see. Yet
here two baby mice were born in the very dead
of winter, and here they grew as strong and warm
and happy as they would have grown had the
season showered rose-petals instead of snowflakes
over the garden above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><i>Hesperomys</i> is the rather woodsy name of the
white-footed or deer-mouse, a shy, timid little
creature dwelling in every wood, who, notwithstanding
his abundance, is an utter stranger to
most of us. We are more familiar with his tracks,
however, than with even those of the squirrel
and rabbit. His is that tiny double trail galloped
across the snowy paths in the woods. We
see them sprinkled over the snow everywhere;
but when have we seen the feet that left them?
Here goes a line of the wee prints from a hole
in the snow near a stump over to the butt of
a large pine. Whitefoot has gone for provender
to one of his storehouses among the roots of the
pine; or maybe a neighbor lives here, and he
has left his nest of bird-feathers in the stump
to make a friendly call after the storm.</p>

<p>A bed of downy feathers at the heart of a
punky old stump beneath the snow would seem
as much of a snuggery as ever a mouse could
build; but it is not. Instead of a dark, warm
chamber within a hollow stump, Whitefoot sometimes
goes to the opposite extreme, and climbs
a leafless tree to an abandoned bird's nest, and
fits this up for his winter home. Down by Cubby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Hollow I found a wood-thrush's nest in a slender
swamp-maple, about fifteen feet from the ground.
The young birds left it late in June, and when
Whitefoot moved in I do not know. But along
in the winter I noticed that the nest looked suspiciously
round and full, as if it were roofed
over. Perhaps the falling leaves had lodged in
it, though this was hardly likely. So I went up
to the sapling and tapped. My suspicions were
correct. After some thumps, a sleepy, frightened
face appeared through the side of the nest,
and looked cautiously down at me. No one
could mistake that pointed nose, those big ears,
and the round pop-eyes so nearly dropping out
with blinking. It was Whitefoot. I had disturbed
his dreams, and he had hardly got his
wits together yet, for he had never been awakened
thus before. And what could wake him?
The black-snakes are asleep, and there is not a
coon or cat living that could climb this spindling
maple. Free from these foes, Whitefoot has
only the owls to fear, and I doubt if even the
little screech-owl could flip through these interlaced
branches and catch the nimble-footed tenant
of the nest.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;It was Whitefoot.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>In spite of the exposure this must be a warm
bed. The walls are thick and well plastered with
mud, and are packed inside with fine, shredded
bark which the mouse himself has pulled from
the dead chestnut limbs, or, more likely, has
taken from a deserted crow's nest. The whole
is thatched with a roof of shredded bark, so
neatly laid that it sheds water perfectly. The
entrance is on the side, just over the edge of
the original structure, but so shielded by the
extending roof that the rain and snow never beat
in. The thrushes did their work well; the nest
is securely mortised into the forking branches;
and Whitefoot can sleep without a tremor
through the wildest winter gale. Whenever
the snow falls lightly a high white tower rises
over the nest; and then the little haycock,
lodged in the slender limbs so far above our
heads, is a very castle indeed.</p>

<p>High over the nest of the white-footed mouse,
in the stiffened top of a tall red oak that stands
on the brow of the hill, swings another winter
bed. It is the bulky oak-leaf hammock of the
gray squirrel.</p>

<p>A hammock for a winter bed? Is there anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
snug and warm about a hammock? Not
much, true enough. From the outside the gray
squirrel's leaf bed looks like the coldest, deadliest
place one could find in which to pass the
winter. The leaves are loose and rattle in the
wind like the clapboards of a tumble-down
house. The limb threatens every moment to
toss the clumsy nest out upon the storm. But
the moorings hold, and if we could curl up with
the sleeper in that swaying bed, we should rock
and dream, and never feel a shiver through the
homespun blankets of chestnut bark that wrap
us round inside the flapping leaves.</p>

<p>Be it never so cozy, a nest like this is far
from a burrow&mdash;the bed of a fat, thick-headed
dolt who sleeps away the winter. A glance into
the stark, frozen top of the oak sends over us a
chill of fright and admiration for the dweller
up there. He cannot be an ease-lover; neither
can he know the meaning of fear. We should
as soon think of a sailor's being afraid of the
shrieking in the rigging overhead, as of this
bold squirrel in the tree-tops dreading any
danger that the winter winds might bring.</p>

<p>There are winters when the gray squirrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
stays in the hollow of some old tree. A secure
and sensible harbor, this, in which to weather
the heavy storms, and I wonder that a nest is
ever anchored outside in the tree-tops. The
woodsmen and other wiseacres say that the
squirrels never build the tree-top nests except
in anticipation of a mild winter. But weather
wisdom, when the gray squirrel is the source, is
as little wise as that which comes from Washington
or the almanac. I have found the nests
in the tree-tops in the coldest, fiercest winters.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;From his leafless height he looks down into the Hollow.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>It is not in anticipation of fine weather, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a wild delight in the free, wild winter, that
leads the gray squirrel to swing his hammock
from the highest limb of the tallest oak that
will hold it. He dares and defies the winds, and
claims their freedom for his own. From his
leafless height yonder he looks down into the
Hollow upon the tops of the swamp trees where
his dizzy roads run along the angled branches,
and over the swamp to the dark pines, and over
the pines, on, on across the miles of white fields
which sweep away and away till they freeze
with the frozen sky behind the snow-clouds that
drift and pile. In his aery he knows the snarl
and bite of the blizzard; he feels the swell of
the heaving waves that drive thick with snow
out of the cold white north. Anchored far out
in the tossing arms of the strong oak, his leaf nest
rocks in the storm like a yawl in a heaving sea.</p>

<p>But he loves the tumult and the terror. A
night never fell upon the woods that awed him;
cold never crept into the trees that could chill
his blood; and the hoarse, mad winds that swirl
and hiss about his pitching bed never shook a
nerve in his round, beautiful body. How he
must sleep! And what a constitution he has!</p>

<p>One November afternoon I found Uncle
Jethro back of the woodshed, drawing a
chalk-mark along the barrel of his old musket,
from the hammer to the sight.</p>

<p>"What are you doing that for, Uncle Jeth?"
I asked.</p>

<p>Of course he took me. We went out about
nine o'clock, and entering the zigzag lane behind
the barn, followed the cow-paths down to
the pasture, then cut across the fields to Lupton's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Pond, the little wood-walled lake which
falls over a dam into the wide meadows along
Cohansey Creek.</p>

<p>It is a wild, secluded spot, so removed that a
pair of black ducks built their nest for several
springs in the deep moss about the upper shore.</p>

<p>It is shallow and deeply crusted over with
lily-pads and pickerel-weed, except for a small
area about the dam, where the water is deep
and clear. There are many stumps in the
upper end; and here, in the shallows, built
upon the hummocks or anchored to the submerged
roots, are the muskrats' houses.</p>

<p>The big moon was rising over the meadows
as we tucked ourselves snugly out of sight in a
clump of small cedars on the bank, within easy
range of the dam and commanding a view of
the whole pond. The domed houses of the
muskrats&mdash;the village numbered six homes&mdash;showed
plainly as the moon came up; and
when the full flood of light fell on the still surface
of the pond, we could see the "roads" of
the muskrats, like narrow channels, leading
down through the pads to the open space about
the dam.</p>

<p>A muskrat's domestic life is erratic. Sometimes
there will be a large village in the pond,
and, again, an autumn will pass without a
single new house being built. It may be
that some of the old houses will be fitted up
anew and occupied; but I have known years
when there was not a house in the pond. At
no time do all of the muskrats build winter
houses. The walls of the meadow ditches just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
under the dam are honeycombed with subterranean
passages, in which many of the muskrats
live the year round. Neither food nor
weather, so far as I have found, influence them
at all in the choice of their winter quarters.
In low, wet meadows where there are no
ditches, the muskrats, of course, live altogether
in mud and reed houses above ground, for the
water would flood the ordinary burrow. These
structures are placed on the tussocks along a
water-hole, so that the dwellers can dive out
and escape under water when danger approaches.
But here in the tide-meadows,
where the ditches are deep, the muskrats rear
their families almost wholly in underground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
rooms. It is only when winter comes, and
family ties dissolve, that a few of the more
sociable or more adventurous club together,
come up to the pond, and while away the cold
weather in these haystack lodges.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i014.jpg" width="300" height="179" alt="Section of muskrat&#39;s house." title="Section of muskrat&#39;s house." />
<span class="caption">Section of muskrat&#39;s house.</span>
</div>

<p>These houses are very simple, but entirely
adequate. If you will lift the top off an ordinary
meadow lodge you will find a single room,
with a bed in the middle, and at least one entrance
and one exit which are always closed to
outsiders by water.</p>

<p>The meadow lodge is built thus: The muskrat
first chooses a large tussock of sedge that
stands well out of the water for his bedstead.
Now, from a foundation below the water, thick
walls of mud and grass are erected inclosing
the tussock; a thatch of excessive thickness is
piled on; the channels leading away from the
doors are dug out if necessary; a bunch of
soaking grass is brought in and made into a
bed on the tussock&mdash;and the muskrat takes
possession.</p>

<p>The pond lodges at the head of Lupton's are
made after this fashion, only they are much
larger, and instead of being raised about, a tussock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of sedge, they are built upon, and inclose,
a part of a log or stump.</p>

<p>This lodge life is surely a cozy, jolly way of
passing the winter. The possums are inclined
to club together whenever they can find stumps
that are roomy enough; but the muskrats
habitually live together through the winter.
Here, in the single room of their house, one
after another will come, until the walls can hold
no more; and, curling up after their night of
foraging, they will spend the frigid days blissfully
rolled into one warm ball of dreamful
sleep. Let it blow and snow and freeze outside;
there are six inches of mud-and-reed wall
around them, and, wrapped deep in rich, warm
fur, they hear nothing of the blizzard and care
nothing for the cold.</p>

<p>Nor are they prisoners of the cold here. The
snow has drifted over their house till only a
tiny mound appears; the ice has sealed the
pond and locked their home against the storm
and desolation without: but the main roadway
from the house is below the drifting snow, and
they know where, among the stumps and button-bushes,
the warm-nosed watchers have kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
breathing-holes open. The ice-maker never
finds their inner stair; its secret door opens
into deep, under-water paths, which run all
over the bottom of the unfrozen pond-world.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;The snow has drifted over their house till only

</div>

<p>Unless roused by the sharp thrust of a spear,
the muskrats will sleep till nightfall. You
may skate around the lodge and even sit down
upon it without waking the sleepers; but plunge
your polo-stick through the top, and you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
hear a smothered <i>plunk, plunk, plunk</i>, as one
after another dives out of bed into the water
below.</p>

<p>The moon climbed higher up the sky and the
minutes ran on to ten o'clock. We waited.
The night was calm and still, and the keen,
alert air brought every movement of the wild
life about us to our ears. The soft, cottony
footfalls of a rabbit, hopping leisurely down the
moonlit path, seemed not unlike the echoing
steps on silent, sleeping streets, as some traveler
passes beneath your window; a wedge of wild
geese <i>honked</i> far over our heads, holding their
mysterious way to the South; white-footed mice
scurried among the dried leaves; and our ears
were so sharpened by the frosty air that we
caught their thin, wiry squeaks.</p>

<p>Presently there was a faint plash among the
muskrat houses. The village was waking up.
Uncle Jethro poked the long nose of his gun
cautiously through the bushes, and watched.
Soon there was a wake in one of the silvery
roads, then a parting of waves, and stemming
silently and evenly toward us, we saw the
round, black head of a muskrat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>It was a pretty sight and a pretty shot; but
I would not have had the stillness and the
moonlit picture spoiled by the blare of that
murderous musket for the pelts of fifty muskrats,
and as the gun was coming to Uncle
Jethro's shoulder, I slipped my hand under the
lifted hammer.</p>

<p>With just an audible grunt of impatience the
old negro understood,&mdash;it was not the first good
shot that my love of wild things had spoiled for
him,&mdash;and the unsuspecting muskrat swam on to
the dam.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;They rubbed
noses.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>A plank had drifted against the bank, and
upon this the little creature scrambled out, as
dry as the cat at home under the roaring
kitchen stove. Down another
road came a second muskrat,
and, swimming across the
open water at the dam,
joined the first-comer
on the plank. They
rubbed noses softly&mdash;the
sweetest of all wild-animal greetings&mdash;and a
moment afterward began to play together.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Two little brown creatures washing calamus.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>They were out for a frolic, and the night was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
splendid. Keeping one eye open for owls, they
threw off all other caution, and swam and dived
and chased each other through the water, with
all the fun of boys in swimming.</p>

<p>On the bottom of the pond about the dam, in
ten or twelve feet of water, was a bed of unios.
I knew that they were there, for I had cut my
feet upon them; and the muskrats knew they
were there, for they had had many a moonlight
lunch of them. These mussels the muskrats
reckon sweetmeats. They are hard to get,
hard to crack, but worth all the cost. I was
not surprised, then, when one of the muskrats
sleekly disappeared beneath the surface, and
came up directly with a mussel.</p>

<p>There was a squabble on the plank, which
ended in the other muskrat's diving for a mussel
for himself. How they opened them I could
not clearly make out, for the shells were almost
concealed in their paws; but judging from
their actions and the appearance of other shells
which they had opened, I should say that they
first gnawed through the big hinge at the back,
then pried open the valves, and ate out the
contents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>Having finished this first course of big-neck
clams, they were joined by a third muskrat,
and, together, they filed over the bank and
down into the meadow. Shortly two of them
returned with great mouthfuls of the mud-bleached
ends of calamus-blades. Then followed
the washing.</p>

<p>They dropped their loads upon the plank,
took up the stalks, pulled the blades apart, and
soused them up and down in the water, rubbing
them with their paws until they were as clean
and white as the whitest celery one ever ate.
What a dainty picture! Two little brown
creatures, humped on the edge of a plank,
washing calamus in moonlit water!</p>

<p>One might have taken them for half-grown
coons as they sat there scrubbing and munching.
Had the big barred owl, from the gum-swamp
down the creek, come along then, he could
easily have bobbed down upon them, and might
almost have carried one away without the other
knowing it, so all-absorbing was the calamus-washing.</p>

<p>Muskrats, like coons, will wash what they
eat, whether washing is needed or not. It is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
necessary preliminary to dinner&mdash;their righteousness,
the little Pharisees! Judging from
the washing disease which ailed two tame muskrats
that I knew, it is perfectly safe to say that
had these found clean bread and butter upon
the plank, instead of muddy calamus, they
would have scoured it just the same.</p>

<p>Before the two on the plank had finished
their meal, the third muskrat returned, dragging
his load of mud and roots to the scrubbing.
He was just dipping into the water when there
was a terrific explosion in my ears, a roar that
echoed round and round the pond. As the
smoke lifted, there were no washers upon the
plank: but over in the quiet water floated
three long, slender tails.</p>

<p>"No man gwine stan' dat shot, boy, jis t' see
a mus'rat wash hi' supper"; and Uncle Jethro
limbered his stiffened knees and went chuckling
down the bank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">&nbsp;</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>The electric cars run past my door, with a
switch almost in front of the house. I can
hear a car rumbling in the woods on the west,
and another pounding through the valley on
the east, till, shrieking, groaning, crunching,
crashing, they dash into view, pause a moment
on the switch, and thunder on to east and west
till out of hearing. Then, for thirty minutes, a
silence settles as deep as it lay here a century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ago. Dogs bark; an anvil rings; wagons rattle
by; and children shout about the cross-roads.
But these sounds have become the natural
voices of the neighborhood&mdash;mother-tongues
like the chat of the brook, the talk of the
leaves, and the caw of the crows. And these
voices, instead of disturbing, seem rather to lull
the stillness.</p>

<p>But the noise of the cars has hardly died
away, and the quiet come, when a long, wild cry
breaks in upon it. <i>Yarup! yarup! yarup-up-up-up-up</i>!
in quick succession sounds the call, followed
instantly by a rapid, rolling beat that
rings through the morning hush like a reveille
with bugle and drum.</p>

<p>It is the cry of the "flicker," the "high-hole."
He is propped against a pole along the street
railroad, nearly a quarter of a mile away. He
has a hole in this pole, almost under the iron
arm that holds the polished, pulsing wire for the
trolley. It is a new house, which the bird has
been working at for more than a week, and it
must be finished now, for this lusty call is an
invitation to the warming. I shall go, and,
between the passing of the cars, witness the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
bowing, the squeaking, the palaver. A high-hole
warming is the most utterly polite function
in birddom.</p>

<p>Some of my friends were talking of birds,
not long ago, when one of them turned to me
and said hopelessly:</p>

<p>"'Tis no use. We can't save them even if
we do stop wearing them upon our hats. Civilization
is bound to sweep them away. We
shall be in a birdless world pretty soon, in spite
of laws and Audubon societies."</p>

<p>I made no reply, but, for an answer, led the
way to the street and down the track to this
pole which High-hole had appropriated. I
pointed out his hole, and asked them to watch.
Then I knocked. Instantly a red head appeared
at the opening. High-hole was mad
enough to eat us; but he changed his mind,
and, with a bored, testy flip, dived into the
woods. He had served my purpose, however,
for his red head sticking out of a hole in a
street-railway pole was as a rising sun in the
east of my friends' ornithological world. New
light broke over this question of birds and
men. The cars drive High-hole away? Not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
long as cars run by overhead wires on wooden
poles.</p>

<p>High-hole is a civilized bird. Perhaps "domesticated"
would better describe him; though
domesticated implies the purposeful effort of
man to change character and habits, while the
changes which have come over High-hole&mdash;and
over most of the wild birds&mdash;are the result of
High-hole's own free choosing.</p>

<p>If we should let the birds have their way
they would voluntarily fall into civilized, if
not into domesticated, habits. They have no
deep-seated hostility toward us; they have not
been the aggressors in the long, bitter war of
extermination; they have ever sued for peace.
Instead of feeling an instinctive enmity, the
birds are drawn toward us by the strongest of
interests. If nature anywhere shows us her
friendship, and her determination, against all
odds, to make that friendship strong, she shows
it through the birds. The way they forgive
and forget, their endless efforts at reconciliation,
and their sense of obligation, ought to
shame us. They sing over every acre that we
reclaim, as if we had saved it for them only;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and in return they probe the lawns most diligently
for worms, they girdle the apple-trees
for grubs, and gallop over the whole wide sky
for gnats and flies&mdash;squaring their account, if
may be, for cherries, orchards, and chimneys.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;They probe the lawns most diligently for worms.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The very crows, in spite of certain well-founded
fears, look upon a new farm&mdash;not upon
the farmer, perhaps&mdash;as a godsend. In the cold
and poverty of winter, not only the crows, but
the jays, quails, buntings, and sparrows, help
themselves, as by right, from our shocks and
cribs. Summer and winter the birds find food
so much more plentiful about the farm and village,
find living in all respects so much easier
and happier here than in remote, wild regions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">&nbsp;</a></span>
that, as a whole, they have become a suburban
people.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Even he loves a listener.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>But life is more than meat for the birds.
There is a subtle yet real attraction for them
in human society. They like its stir and
change, its attention and admiration. The
shyest and most modest of the birds pines for
appreciation. The cardinal grosbeak, retiring
as he is, cannot believe that he was born to
blush unseen&mdash;to the tip of his beautiful crest.
And the hermit-thrush, meditative, spiritual,
and free as the heart of the swamp from worldliness&mdash;even
he loves a listener, and would not
waste his sweetness any longer on desert forest
air. I do not know a single bird who does not
prefer a wood with a wagon-road through it.</p>

<p>My friends had smiled at such assertions before
their introduction to the bird in the pole.
They knew just enough of woodpeckers to expect
High-hole to build in the woods, and, when
driven from there, to disappear, to extinguish
himself, rather than stoop to an existence within
walls of hardly the dignity and privacy of
a hitching-post.</p>

<p>He is a proud bird and a wild bird, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
practical, sensible bird withal. Strong of wing
and mighty of voice, he was intended for a vigorous,
untamed life, and even yet there is the
naked savage in his bound and his whoop. But
electric cars have come, with smooth-barked
poles, and these are better than rotten trees,
despite the jangle and hum of wires and the
racket of grinding wheels. Like the rest of us,
he has not put off his savagery: he has simply
put on civilization. Street cars are a convenience
and a diversion. He has wings and
wildest freedom any moment, and so, even
though heavy timber skirts the track and
shadows his pole, and though across the road
opposite stands a house where there are children,
dogs, and cats, nevertheless, High-hole
follows his fancy, and instead of building back
in the seclusion and safety of the woods, comes
out to the street, the railroad, the children, and
the cats, and digs him a modern house in this
sounding cedar pole.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is imagination, but I think that I
can actually see High-hole changing his wood
ways for the ways of the village. He grows
tamer and more trustful every summer.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;She flew across the pasture.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>A pair have their nest in a telegraph-pole
near the school-house, where they are constantly
mauled by the boys. I was passing one day
when two youngsters rushed to the pole and
dragged out the poor harassed hen for my edification.
She was seized by one wing, and came
out flapping, her feathers pulled and splintered.
She had already lost all but two quills from her
tail through previous exhibitions. I opened
my hands, and she flew across the pasture to the
top of a tree, and waited patiently till we went
away. She then returned, knowing, apparently,
that we were boys and a necessary evil
of village life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>But this pole-life marks only half the distance
that these birds have come from the
woods.</p>

<p>One warm Sunday of a recent March, in the
middle of my morning sermon, a ghostly rapping
was heard through the meeting-house. I
paused. <i>Tap, tap, tap!</i> hollow and ominous it
echoed. Every soul was awake in an instant.
Was it a summons from&mdash;? But two of the
small boys grinned; some one whispered
"flicker"; and I gathered my ornithological
wits together in time to save the pause and
proceed with the service.</p>

<p>After the people went home I found three
flicker-holes in the latticework over the north
windows. One of last year's tenants had got
back that morning from the South, and had
gone to work cleaning up and putting things
to rights in his house, regardless of Sabbath
and sermon.</p>

<p>This approach of the flicker to domestic life
and human fellowship is an almost universal
movement among the birds. And no tendency
anywhere in wild life is more striking. The
four-footed animals are rapidly disappearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
before the banging car and spreading town, yet
the birds welcome these encroachments and
thrive on them. One never gets used to the
contrast in the bird life of uninhabited places
with that about human dwellings. Thoreau
tells his wonder and disappointment at the
dearth of birds in the Maine woods; Burroughs
reads about it, and goes off to the mountains,
but has himself such an aggravated shock of
the same surprise that he also writes about it.
The few hawks and rarer wood species found in
these wild places are shy and elusive. More
and more, in spite of all they know of us, the
birds choose our proximity over the wilderness.
Indeed, the longer we live together, the less
they fear and suspect us.</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p>Using my home for a center, you may describe
a circle of a quarter-mile radius and all the way
round find that radius intersecting either a
house, a dooryard, or an orchard. Yet within
this small and settled area I found one summer
thirty-six species of birds nesting. Can any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">&nbsp;</a></span>

bird life?</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;A very ordinary New
England &#39;corner.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The nightingale, the dodo, and the ivorybill
were not among these thirty-six. What then?
If one can live on an electric-car line, inside the
borders of a fine city, have his church across the
road, his blacksmith on the corner, his neighbors
within easy call, and, with all this, have
any thirty-six species of birds nesting within
ear-shot, ought he to ache for the Archæopteryx,
or rail at civilization as a destroyer?</p>

<p>There is nothing remarkable about this bit of
country. I could plant myself at the center of
such a circle anywhere for miles around and
find just as many birds. Perhaps the land is
more rocky and hilly, the woods thicker, the
gardens smaller here than is common elsewhere
in eastern Massachusetts; otherwise, aside from
a gem of a pond, this is a very ordinary New
England "corner."</p>

<p>On the west side of my yard lies a cultivated
field, beyond which stands an ancient apple
orchard; on the east the yard is hedged by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
tract of sprout-land which is watched over by a
few large pines; at the north, behind the house
and garden, runs a wall of chestnut and oak,
which ten years ago would have been cut but
for some fortunate legal complication. Such
is the character of the whole neighborhood.
Patches of wood and swamp, pastures, orchards,
and gardens, cut in every direction by roads and
paths, and crossed by one tiny stream&mdash;this is
the circle of the thirty-six.</p>

<p>Not one of these nests is beyond a stone's
throw from a house. Seven of them, indeed, are
in houses or barns, or in boxes placed about
the dooryards; sixteen of them are in orchard
trees; and the others are distributed along the
roads, over the fields, and in the woods.</p>

<p>Among the nearest of these feathered neighbors
is a pair of bluebirds with a nest in one of
the bird-boxes in the yard. The bluebirds are
still untamed, building, as I have often found, in
the wildest spots of the woods; but seen about
the house, there is something so reserved, so
gentle and refined in their voice and manner as
to shed an atmosphere of good breeding about
the whole yard. What a contrast they are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">&nbsp;</a></span>

<span class="caption">&quot;They are the first to
return in the spring.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>They are the first to return in the spring; the
spring, rather, comes back with them. They
are its wings. It could not come on any others.
If it tried, say, the tanager's, would we believe
and accept it? The bluebird is the only possible
interpreter of those first dark signs of
March; through him we have faith in the
glint of the pussy-willows, in the half-thawed
peep of the hylas, and in the northward flying
of the geese. Except for his return, March
would be the one month of all the twelve never
looked at from the woods and waysides. He
comes, else we should not know that the waters
were falling, that a leaf could be plucked in all
the bare, muddy world.</p>

<p>Our feelings for the bluebird are much mixed.
His feathers are not the attraction. He is
bright, but on the whole rather plainly dressed.
Nor is it altogether his voice that draws us;
the snowflakes could hardly melt into tones
more mellow, nor flecks of the sky's April blue
run into notes more limpid, yet the bluebird
is no singer. The spell is in the spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
bird. He is the soul of this somber season,
voicing its sadness and hope. What other bird
can take his place and fill his mission in the
heavy, hopeful days of March? We are in no
mood for gaiety and show. Not until the
morning stars quarrel together will the cat-bird
or scarlet tanager herald the spring. The irreverent
song of a cat-bird in the gray gloom
of March would turn the spring back and draw
the winter out of his uncovered grave. The
bluebird comes and broods over this death and
birth, until the old winter sleeps his long sleep,
and the young spring wakes to her beautiful life.</p>

<p><i>Within</i> my house is another very human little
bird&mdash;the chimney-swallow. Sharing our very
firesides as he does, he surely ought to have a
warm place in our hearts; but where have I
ever read one word expressing the affection for
him that is universally shown the bluebird?</p>

<p>I am thinking of our American swallow. We
all know how Gilbert White loved his chimney-swallows&mdash;how
he loved every creature that
flew or crawled about the rectory. Was it an
ancient tortoise in the garden? the sheep upon
the downs? a brood of birds in the chimney?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">&nbsp;</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>No matter. Let the creatures manifest never
so slight a friendliness for him, let them claim
never so little of his protection, and the good
rector's heart went out toward them as it might
toward children of his own.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Where the dams are hawking for flies.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>But the swallows were White's fondest care.
He and his hirundines were inseparable. He
thought of them, especially those of the chimney,
as members of his household. One can detect
almost a father's interest and joy in his
notes upon these little birds. Listen to the
parent in this bit about the young in Letter
XVIII. They are just out of the chimney.</p>

<p>"They play about near the place where the
dams are hawking for flies; and when a mouthful
is collected, at a certain signal given, the dam and
the nestling advance, rising toward each other,
and meeting at an angle; the young one all the
while uttering such a little quick note of gratitude
and complacency that a person must have
paid very little regard to the wonders of nature
that has not often remarked this feat."</p>

<p>Has anything been written about our swift
showing as faithful and sympathetic observation
as that? No. He comes and goes without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
one, like Gilbert White, being cheered by his
twitter or interested in his doings. Perhaps it
is because we have so many brighter, sweeter
birds about us here; or perhaps our chimneys
are higher than those of Selborne Rectory; or
maybe we have no Gilbert White over here.</p>

<p>Of course we have no Gilbert White. We
have not had time to produce one. The union
of man and nature which yields the naturalist
of Selborne is a process of time. Our soil and
our sympathy are centuries savager than England's.
We still look at our lands with the
spirit of the ax; we are yet largely concerned
with the contents of the gizzards of our birds.
Shall the crows and cherry-birds be exterminated?
the sparrows transported? the owls and
hawks put behind bars? Not until the collectors
at Washington pronounce upon these
first questions can we hope for a naturalist who
will find White's wonders in the chimney-swallow.</p>

<p>These little swifts are not as attractive as
song-sparrows. They are sooty&mdash;worse than
sooty sometimes; their clothes are too tight for
them; and they are less musical than a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
boy with "clappers." Nevertheless I could ill
spare them from my family. They were the
first birds I knew, my earliest home being so
generous in its chimneys as to afford lodgings to
several pairs of them. This summer they again
share my fireside, squeaking, scratching, and
thundering in the flue as they used to when, real
goblins, they came scrambling down to peek and
spy at me. I should miss them from the chimney
as I should the song-sparrows from the
meadow. They are above the grate, to be sure,
while I am in front of it; but we live in
the same house, and there is only a wall between
us.</p>

<p>If the chimney would be a dark, dead hole
without the swifts, how empty the summer sky
would be were they not skimming, darting, wiggling
across every bright hour of it! They
are tireless fliers, feeding, bathing, love-making,
and even gathering the twigs for their nests on
the wing, never alighting, in fact, after leaving
the chimney until they return to it. They rest
while flying. Every now and then you will see
them throw their wings up over their heads till
the tips almost touch, and, in twos or threes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
scale along to the time of their jolly, tuneless
rattle.</p>

<p>From May to September, is there a happier
sight than a flock of chimney-swallows, just before
or just after a shower, whizzing about the
tops of the corn or coursing over the river, like
so many streaks of black lightning, ridding the
atmosphere of its overcharge of gnats! They
cut across the rainbow and shoot into the rose- and
pearl-washed sky, and drop&mdash;into the depths
of a soot-clogged chimney!</p>

<p>These swallows used to build in caves and in
clean, hollow trees; now they nest only in
chimneys. So far have they advanced in civilization
since the landing of the Pilgrims!</p>

<p>Upon the beams in the top of the barn the
brown-breasted, fork-tailed barn-swallows have
made their mud nests for years. These birds
are wholly domesticated. We cannot think of
them as wild. And what a place in our affections
they have won! If it is the bluebirds
that bring the spring, the barn-swallows fetch
the summer. They take us back to the farm.
We smell the hay, we see the cracks and knot-holes
of light cutting through the fragrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">&nbsp;</a></span>
gloom of the mows, we hear the munching
horses and the summer rain upon the shingles,
every time a barn-swallow slips past us.</p>

<img src="images/i025.jpg" width="400" height="596" alt="rainbow" title="rainbow" />
<span class="caption">&quot;They cut across
the rainbow.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>For grace of form and poetry of motion there
is no rival for the barn-swallow. When on
wing, where else, between the point of a beak
and the tips of a tail, are there so many marvelous
curves, such beautiful balance of parts? On
the wing, I say. Upon his feet he is as awkward
as the latest Herreshoff yacht upon the
stays. But he is the yacht of the air. Every
line of him is drawn for racing. The narrow,
wide-reaching wings and the long, forked tail
are the perfection of lightness, swiftness, and
power. A master designed him&mdash;saved every
possible feather's weight, bent from stem to
stern, and rigged him to outsail the very winds.</p>

<p>From the barn to the orchard is no great
journey; but it is the distance between two
bird-lands. One must cross the Mississippi basin,
the Rocky Mountains, or the Pacific Ocean to
find a greater change in bird life than he finds
in leaping the bars between the yard and the
orchard.</p>

smile in the agony of her civilization.
Men may level the forests, clear the land and
fence it; but as long as they plant orchards,
bird life, at least, will survive and prosper.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;From the barn to the orchard.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Except for the warblers, one acre of apple-trees
is richer in the variety of its birds than
ten acres of woods. In the three unkempt, decrepit
orchards hereabout, I found the robin,
chippy, orchard-oriole, cherry-bird, king-bird,
crow-blackbird, bluebird, chebec, tree-swallow,
flicker, downy woodpecker, screech-owl, yellow
warbler, redstart, and great-crested flycatcher&mdash;all
nesting as rightful heirs and proprietors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
This is no small share of the glory of the whole
bird world.</p>

<p>I ought not to name redstart as a regular occupant
of the orchard. He belongs to the woods,
and must be reckoned a visitor to the apple-trees,
only an occasional builder, at best. The
orchard is too open for him. He is an actor,
and needs a leafy setting for his stage. In the
woods, against a dense background of green, he
can play butterfly with charming effect, can
spread himself and flit about like an autumn
leaf or some wandering bit of paradise life,
with wings of the grove's richest orange light
and its deepest shadow.</p>

<p>When, however, he has a fancy for the orchard,
this dainty little warbler shows us what
the wood-birds can do in the way of friendship
and sociability.</p>

<p>Across the road, in an apple-tree whose
branches overhang a kitchen roof, built a pair
of redstarts. No one discovered the birds till
the young came; then both parents were seen
about the yard the whole day long. They were
as much at home as the chickens, even more
familiar. Having a leisure moment one day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">&nbsp;</a></span>
when a bicycle was being cleaned beneath the
tree, the inquisitive pair dropped down, the
female actually lighting upon the handle-bar to
see how the dusting was done. On another occasion
she attempted to settle upon the baby
swinging under the tree in a hammock; and
again, when I caught one of her own babies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
my hands, she came, bringing a worm, and,
without the slightest fear of me, tried to feed
it. Yet she was somewhat daunted by the trap
in which her infant was struggling; she would
fan my hands with her wings, then withdraw,
not able to muster quite enough courage to
settle upon them.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i028.jpg" width="400" height="392" alt="pair of redstarts" title="pair of redstarts" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Across the road, in an apple-tree, built a pair of redstarts.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Neither of these birds ever showed alarm at
the people of the house. In fact, I never saw
a redstart who seemed to know that we humans
ought to be dreaded. These birds are now as
innocent of suspicion as when they came up to
Adam to be named. On two occasions, during
severe summer storms, they have fluttered at
my windows for shelter, and dried their feathers,
as any way-worn traveler might, in safety beneath
my roof.</p>

<p>From the window one morning I saw Chebec,
the least flycatcher, light upon the clothes-line.
She teetered a moment, balancing her
big head by her loosely jointed tail, then leaped
lightly into the air, turned,&mdash;as only a flycatcher
can,&mdash;and, diving close to the ground, gathered
half the gray hairs of a dandelion into her
beak, and darted off. I followed instantly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
soon found her nest in one of the orchard trees.
It was not quite finished; and while the bird
was gone for more of the dandelion down, I
climbed up and seated myself within three feet
of the nest.</p>

<p>Back came Mrs. Chebec with a swoop, but,
on seeing me, halted short of the nest. I was
motionless. Hopping cautiously toward the
nest, she took an anxious look inside; finding
nothing disturbed, she concluded that there was
no evil in me, and so went on with her interesting
work. It was a pretty sight. In a quiet,
capable, womanly way she laid the lining in,
making the nest, in her infinite mother-love, fit
for eggs with shells of foam.</p>

<p>The chebec is a finished architect. Better
builders are few indeed. The humming-bird is
slower, more painstaking, and excels Chebec in
outside finish. But Chebec's nest is so deep, so
soft, so round and hollow! There is the loveliness
of pure curve in its walls. And small wonder!
She bends them about the beautiful mold
of her own breast. Whenever she entered with
the dandelion cotton, she went round and round
these walls, before leaving, pressing them fondly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
with her chin close against her breast. She
could not make them sufficiently safe nor half
lovely enough for the white, fragile treasures to
be cradled there.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i029.jpg" width="350" height="283" alt="building a nest" title="building a nest" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Gathered half the gray hairs of a dandelion into her beak.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Artists though they be, the chebecs, nevertheless,
are very tiresome birds. They think
that they can sing&mdash;a sad, sorry, maddening
mistake. Mr. Chapman says the day that song
was distributed among the birds the chebecs sat
on a back seat. Would they had been out
catching flies! In the chatter of the English
sparrow, no matter how much I may resent his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
impudence and swagger, there is something so
bright and lively that I never find him really
tiresome. But the chebecs come back very
early in spring, and sit around for days and
days, catching flies, and jerking their heads and
calling, <i>Chebec! chebec! chebec!</i> till you wish their
heads would snap off.</p>

<p>In the tree next to the chebec's was a brood
of robins. The crude nest was wedged carelessly
into the lowest fork of the tree, so that
the cats and roving boys could help themselves
without trouble. The mother sputtered and
worried and scolded without let-up, trying to
make good her foolishness in fixing upon such a
site by abundance of anxiety and noise.</p>

<p>The fussiest, least sensible mother among
the birds is the robin. Any place for her nest
but a safe one! The number of young robins
annually sacrificed to pure parental carelessness
is appalling. The female chooses the
site for the home, and her ability for blundering
upon unattractive and exposed locations
amounts to genius. She insists upon building
on the sand. Usually the rain descends, the
floods come, the winds blow, and there is a fall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Here is a pair building upon a pile of boards
under a cherry-tree; another pair plaster their
nest to the rider of an old worm-fence; while a
third couple, abandoning the woods near by,
plant theirs, against all remonstrance, upon
the top of a step-ladder that the brickmakers
use daily in their drying-sheds.</p>

<p>It was the superlative stupidity of this robin
that saved her family. The workmen at first
knocked her nest off to the ground. She had
plenty of clay at hand, however, and began her
nest again, following the ladder as it moved
about the shed. Such amazing persistence won,
of course. Out of wonder, finally, the men gave
the ladder over to her and stood aside till her
family affairs were attended to. Everything
was right in time. After infinite scolding, she
at last came off in triumph, with her brood of
four.</p>

<p>A striking illustration of this growing alliance
between us and the birds is the nest of the great-crested
flycatcher in the orchard. Great-crest
has almost become an orchard-bird. At heart
he is, and ever will be, a bird of the wilds. He
is not tame&mdash;does not want to be tame; he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
bold, and the dangers and advantages of orchard
life attract him. His moving into an apple
orchard is no less a wonder than would be an
Apache chief's settling in New York or Boston.</p>

<p>Most observers still count Great-crest among
the wild and unreclaimed. Florence A. Merriam,
speaking of his return in spring, says:
"Not many days pass, however, before he is so
taken up with domestic matters that his voice
is rarely heard outside the woods"; and in
Stearns's "Birds" I find: "It does not court the
society of man, but prefers to keep aloof in the
depths of the forest, where it leads a wild, shy,
and solitary life." This is not Great-crest as I
know him. I have found many of his nests,
and never one in any but orchard trees. Riding
along a country road lately, I heard Great-crest's
call far ahead of me. I soon spied
him on the wires of a telegraph-pole. Under
him was a pear-tree, and a hundred yards away
a farm-house. In the pear-tree I found his
nest&mdash;snake-skins and all.</p>

<p>I disagree, too, with most descriptions of this
bird's cry. The authors I have read seem never
to have heard him on a quiet May morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
across a fifty-acre field. His voice is "harsh
and discordant" when sounded into one's very
ears. The sweetest-toned organ would be discordant
to one inside the instrument. Give the
bird the room he demands,&mdash;wide, early-morning
fields,&mdash;and listen. A single shout, almost
human it seems, wild, weird, and penetrating,
yet clear and smooth as the blast of a bugle.
One can never forget it, nor resist it; for it
thrills like a resurrection call&mdash;the last, long
summons to the spring waking. This solitary
note is often repeated, but is never so rapid
nor so long drawn out as the call of the flicker.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i031.jpg" width="400" height="292" alt="on the
wires" title="on the wires" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I soon spied him on the
wires of a telegraph-pole.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>Great-crest is a character, one of the most
individual of all our birds. What other bird
lines his nest with snake-skins? or hangs such
gruesome things out for latch-strings? He has
taken up his residence among us, but he has
given us pretty plainly to understand that we
need not call, else I mistake the hint in the
scaly skin that dangles from his door. The
strong personality of the bird is stamped even
upon its eggs. Where are any to match them
for curious, crazy coloring? The artist had
purple inks, shading all the way from the deepest
chestnut-purple to the faintest lilac. With
a sharp pen he scratched the shell from end to
end with all his colors till it was covered, then
finished it off with a few wild flourishes and
crosswise scrawls.</p>

<p>Like the birds of the orchards and buildings,
the field-birds also are yielding to human influences.
We can almost say that we have an
order of farm-birds, so many species seem to
have become entirely dependent upon the pasture
and grain-field.</p>

<p>"Where did Bobolink disport himself before
there were meadows in the North and rice-fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in the South? Was he the same lithe,
merry-hearted beau then as now?" I do not
know. But I do know that, in the thirty and
three years since Mr. Burroughs asked the question,
Bobolink has lost none of his nimbleness,
nor forgotten one bubbling, tinkling note of his
song. Yet in his autumn journey South, from
the day he reaches the ripe reeds of the Jersey
marshes till he is lost in the wide rice-lands of
Georgia, his passage is through a ceaseless, pitiless
storm of lead. Dare he return to us in
spring? and can he ever sing again? He will
come if May comes&mdash;forgetting and forgiving,
dressed in as gay a suit as ever, and just as full
of song.</p>

<p>There is no marvel of nature's making equal
to the miracle of her temper toward man. How
gladly she yields to his masterful dominion!
How sufferingly she waits for him to grow out
of his spoiled, vicious childhood. The spirit of
the bobolink ought to exorcise the savage out
of us. It ought, and it does&mdash;slowly.</p>

<p>We are trying, for instance, to cow the savage
in us by law, to restrain it while the birds are
breeding; but we hardly succeed yet. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
mating season is scarcely over, the young not
yet grown, when the gunners about me go into
the fields with their dogs and locate every covey
of quail, even counting the number of birds in
each. With the dawn of the first day of open
season they are out, going from flock to flock,
killing, till the last possible bird is in their
bloody bags.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;He will come if May comes.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>One of the most pathetic of all the wordless
cries of the out-of-doors is the covey-call of
the female quail at night, trying to gather the
scattered flock together after the dogs are called
off and the hunters have gone home.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Within a few feet of me dropped the lonely frightened quail.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>It was nearly dark one December afternoon,
the snow ankle-deep and falling swiftly, when,
crossing a wide field, I heard this call from a
piece of sprout-land ahead of me. Kneeling
in the snow, I answered the whistle. Instantly
came a reply. Back and forth we signaled till
there was a whir of wings, and down in the soft
snow within a few feet of me dropped the lonely,
frightened quail. She was the only one left of a
covey that the night before had roosted unbroken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
snugly wedged, with their tails together,
under a pile of brush.</p>

<p>Sharing the fields with the quails are the
meadow-larks. They scale along the grass,
rarely rising higher than the cedars, flapping
rapidly for a short distance, then sailing a little
in a cautious, breath-held manner, as though
wings were a new invention and just a trifle
dangerous yet. On they go to a fence-stake, and
land with many congratulatory flirts of wings
and tail. Has anybody observed the feat?
They look around. Yes; here I sit,&mdash;a man on a
fence across the field,&mdash;and the lark turns toward
me and calls out: "Did you see me?"</p>

<p>He would be the best-bred, most elegant of
our birds, were it not for his self-consciousness.
He is consumed with it. There is too much
gold and jet on his breast. But, in spite of all
this, the plain, rich back and wings, the slender
legs, the long, delicate beak, the erect carriage,
the important air, the sleek, refined appearance,
compel us to put him down an aristocrat.</p>

<p>In a closely cropped pasture near the house,
in early June, I found the eggs of the night-hawk.
There was no nest, of course: the eggs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
lay upon the grass, and, for safety, had been left
directly under the fence. The cows might not
step on them here, but nothing prevented their
crushing the fragile things with their noses.</p>

<p>Lengthwise, upon one of the rails, slept the
mother. She zigzagged off at my approach, dazzled
and uncertain in the white light of the
noon, making no outcry nor stopping an instant
to watch the fate of her eggs. She acted like a
huge bat, slinking and dodging, out of her element
in the light, and anxious to be hid. She
did not seem like a creature that had a voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and the way she flew would make one think
that she did not know the use of her wings.
But what a circus flier she is at night! and with
what an uncanny noise she haunts the twilight!
She has made more hair stand on end, with
her earthward plunge and its unearthly boom
through the dusk, than all the owls together. It
is a ghostly joke. And who would believe in
the daylight that this limp, ragged lump, dozing
upon the fence or the kitchen roof, could play
the spook so cleverly in the dark?</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p>On the 25th of April, before the trees were in
leaf, I heard the first true wood-note of the
spring. It came from the tall oaks beyond the
garden. "<i>Clear, clear, clear up!</i>" it rang, pure,
untamed, and quickening. The solitary vireo!
It was his whistle, inimitable, unmistakable; and
though I had not seen him since last July, I hurried
out to the woods, sure he would greet me.</p>

<p>Solitary is the largest, rarest, tamest, and
sweetest-voiced of the vireos. I soon found him
high in the tops of the trees; but I wanted him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
nearer. He would not descend. So I chased
him, stoning and mocking him even, till, at last,
he came down to the bushes and showed me his
big blue head, white eye-rings, wing-bars, and
yellow-washed sides.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i035.jpg" width="400" height="288" alt="singing" title="singing" />
<span class="caption">&quot;It was a love-song.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>He did more than show himself: he sang for
me. Within ten feet of me, he began a quiet
little warble of a tenderness and contentment I
never heard before. Such variety of notes, such
sweetness of melody, such easy, unconscious rendering!
It was a love-song, but sung all to
himself, for he knew that there was no gentle
heart to listen this side of Virginia. He sang to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
his own happy heart as pure and sweet a song
as the very angels know.</p>

<p>Solitary disappeared from that day. I concluded
he had gone to heavier, wilder woods to
nest. It was late in June that, passing through
this brush-land, I saw hanging from an oak sapling,
just above my head, a soft, yellowish basket.
It was a vireo's nest; but it was too large, too
downy, too yellow for Red-eye. There were no
bunches of white spider-webs upon it, such as
Red-eye hangs all over his nest. I stepped aside
for a better view, and had just caught the glint
of a large, white-ringed eye peering over the
nest's edge at me, when, off in the woods behind
me, the noon hush was startled by Solitary's
whistle&mdash;a round, pure, pearly note that broke
the quiet as pearly teeth break through the smile
of a beautiful face. He soon appeared, coming
on, a tree at a time, looking and asking, in no
hurry and in no alarm. When he reached the
pine overhead, his mate left the nest to confer
with him. They scolded me mildly while I
climbed for a look at the four delicately spotted
eggs; but as soon as I lay down upon the ground,
the mother, without fuss or fear, slipped into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
nest and cuddled down over the eggs till her
head hardly showed above the rim. Had a few
bushes been removed I could have seen the nest
from my front door.</p>

<p>Why do the wood-birds so persistently build
their nests along the paths and roads? I said
that even the hermit-thrush prefers a wood with
a road through it. If he possibly can he will
build along that road. And what one of the
birds will not? Is it mere stupidity? Is it curiosity
to see what goes on? Is there some safety
here from enemies worse than boys and cats and
dogs? Or is it that these birds take this chance
for human fellowship? If this last is the reason
for their rejecting the deep tangles for limbs that
overhang roads and tufts of grass in constantly
traveled foot-paths, then they can be pardoned;
otherwise they are foolish&mdash;fatally foolish.</p>

<p>The first black-and-white warbler's nest I ever
found was at the base of a clump of bushes in a
narrow wood-path not ten feet from a highway.
There were acres of bushes beyond, thick and
pathless, all theirs to choose from.</p>

<p>In the same piece of scrub-oak the summer
after I found another black-and-white warbler's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
nest. The loud talk of three of the birds attracted
me. Two of them were together, and
just mated, evidently; the third was a male, and
just as plainly the luckless suitor. He was
trying to start a quarrel between the young
couple, doing his best to make the new bride
break her vows. He flew just ahead of them,
darting to the ground, scuttling under the brush,
and calling out, "See here! Come here! Don't
fool with him any longer! I have the place
for a nest!"</p>

<p>But the pair kept on together, chatting
brightly as they ran up and down the trees and
hunted under the fallen limbs and leaves for a
home-site. The male led the way and found the
places; the female passed judgment. I followed
them.</p>

<p>Every spot the cock peeped into was the finest
in the woods; his enthusiasm was constant and
unbounded. "Any place is heaven," he kept
repeating, "any place, so long as I have you."
But she was to do the housekeeping, and the
ecstasies of the honeymoon were not to turn her
head. She was house-hunting; and, like every
woman, at her best. She said "no," and "no,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and "no." I began to think they never would
find the place, when the male darted far ahead
and went out of sight beneath some low huckleberry-bushes
near a stone wall. This wall ran
between the woods and a pasture; and parallel
with it, on the woods side, was a foot-path.</p>

<p>Up came the little hen, and together they
scratched about under the leaves. Suddenly the
cock flew away and fetched a strip of chestnut
bark. This he turned over to his wife. Then
both birds flew out to the chestnut limbs for
bark, and brought their strips back. The home
was founded.</p>

<p>It was the merest cavity, pushed into the dead
leaves, with three shreds of bark for first timbers.
In less than a week the structure was finished
and furnished&mdash;with a tiny white egg thickly
sprinkled with brown. I watched the spot daily,
and finally saw the four young warblers safely
out into their new woods-world. But from the
day the first egg was laid until the nestlings left
I constantly expected to find everything crushed
under the foot of some passer-by.</p>

<p>When free from household cares the chickadee
is the most sociable of the birds of the woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">&nbsp;</a></span>
But he takes family matters seriously, and withdraws
so quietly to the unfrequented parts of the
woods during nesting-time as to seem to have
migrated. Yet of the four chickadees' nests
found about the house, one was in a dead yellow
birch in a bit of deep swamp, two others were in
yellow birches along wood-roads, and the fourth
was in a rotten fence-post by the main road, a
long way from any trees.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;But the pair kept on together,
chatting brightly.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>A workman while mending the fence discovered
this last nest. The post crumbled in his
hands as he tried to pull it down, revealing the
nest of moss and rabbit hair, with its five brown-and-white
eggs. He left the old post, propped
it up with a sound one, and, mending the broken
walls of the cavity the best he could, hurried
along with his task, that the birds might return.
They came back, found the wreckage of dust and
chips covering the eggs, tried the flimsy walls&mdash;and
went away. It was a desecrated home, neither
safe nor beautiful now; so they forsook it.</p>

<p>There is no eagle's nest in this collection of
thirty-six. But if Mr. Burroughs is correct,
there is the next thing to it&mdash;a humming-bird's
nest; three of them, indeed, one of which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
within a stone's throw
of my door! This one
is in the oaks behind
my garden, but the
other two are even
nearer to houses. One
of these is upon the
limb of a pear-tree.
The tip of this limb
rubs against a woodshed
connected with
a dwelling. The third
nest is in a large apple
orchard, in the
tree nearest the house,
and saddled upon that
branch of the tree
which reaches farthest
toward the dwelling.
So close is this nest
that I can look out of
the garret window
directly into it.</p>

<p>I believe that Ruby-throat
is so far domesticated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that he rejoices over every new flowergarden.
There was nearly half an acre of gladioli
in the neighborhood one summer, where all
the humming-birds gathered from far and near.
Here, for the only time in my life, I saw a <i>flock</i>
of humming-birds. I counted eight one day;
and the gardener told me that he had often seen
a dozen of them among the spikes. They
squeaked like bats, and played&mdash;about as bullets
might play. In fact, I think I dodged when they
whizzed past me, as a soldier does the first time
he is under fire.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;So close I can look directly into it.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>One of my friends had a cellar window abloom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
with geraniums. A ruby-throat came often to
this window. One day the mistress of the flowers
caught the wee chap in her hands. He knew at
once that she meant no harm and quietly submitted.
A few days later he returned and was
captured again. He liked the honey, and evidently
the fondling, too, for he came very regularly
after that for the nectar and the lady's
soft hands.</p>

<p>The nest behind my garden is in the top of a
tall, slender maple, with oaks and chestnuts surrounding
and overshadowing it. Finding a nest
like this is inspiration for the rest of life. The
only feat comparable to it is the discovery of a
bee-tree. Finding wild bees, I think, would be
good training for one intending to hunt humming-birds'
nests in the woods. But no one ever had
such an intention. No one ever deliberately
started into the woods a-saying, "Go to, now; I'll
find a humming-bird's nest in here!"</p>

<p>Humming-birds' nests are the gifts of the gods&mdash;rewards
for patience and for gratitude because
of commoner grants. My nests have invariably
come this way, or, if you choose, by accident.
The nearest I ever came to earning one was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the case of this one in the maple. I caught a
glimpse of a humming-bird flashing around the
high limbs of a chestnut, so far up that she looked
no bigger than a hornet. I suspected instantly
that she was gathering lichens for a nest, and, as
she darted off, I threw my eyes ahead of her
across her path. It was just one chance in ten
thousand if I even saw her speeding through the
limbs and leaves, if I got the line of her flight,
to say nothing of a clue to her nesting-place. It
was little short of a miracle. I had tried many
times before to do it, but this is the only time I
ever succeeded: my line of vision fell directly
upon the tiny builder as she dropped to her nest
in the sapling.</p>

<p>The structure was barely started. I might
have stared at it with the strongest glass and
never made it out a nest; the sapling, too, was
no thicker at the butt than my wrist, and I
should not have dreamed of looking into its tall,
spindling top for any kind of a nest. Furthermore,
as if to rob one of the last possibility of
discovering it, a stray bud, two years before, had
pushed through the bark of the limb about three
inches behind where the nest was to be fixed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
had grown, till now its leaves hung over the
dainty house in an almost perfect canopy and
screen.</p>

<p>For three weeks the walls of this house were
going up. Is it astonishing that, when finished,
they looked like a growth of the limb, like part
and parcel of the very tree? I made a daily
visit to the sapling until the young birds flew
away; then I bent the tree to the ground and
brought the nest home. It now hangs above my
desk, its thick walls, its downy bed, its leafy
canopy telling still of the little mother's unwearied
industry, of her infinite love and foresight.
So faultlessly formed, so safely saddled to
the limb, so exquisitely lichened into harmony
with the green around, this tiniest nest speaks
for all of the birds. How needless, how sorry,
would be the loss of these beautiful neighbors of
our copses and fields!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>There are many lovers of the out-of-doors
who court her in her robes of roses and in
her blithe and happy hours of bird-song only.
Now a lover that never sees her barefoot in the
meadow, that never hears her commonplace
chatter at the frog-pond, that never finds her in
her lowly, humdrum life among the toads and
snakes, has little genuine love for his mistress.</p>

<p>To know the pixy when one sees it, to call the
long Latin name of the ragweed, to exclaim over
the bobolink's song, to go into ecstasies at a glorious
sunset, is not, necessarily, to love nature at
all. One who does all this sincerely, but who
stuffs his ears to the din of the spring frogs, is
in love with nature's pretty clothes, her dainty
airs and fine ways. Her warm, true heart lies
deeper down. When one has gone down to that,
then a March without peepers will be as lonesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
as a crowd without friends; then an orchard
without the weather-wise hyla can never make
good his place with mere apples; and the front
door without a solemn, philosophic toad beneath
its step will lack something quite as needful to
its evening peace and homeness as it lacks when
the old-fashioned roses and the honeysuckle are
gone.</p>

<p>We are not humble nor thoughtful out of
doors. There is too much sentiment in our passion
for nature. We make colored plates and
poems to her. All honor to the poets! especially
to those who look carefully and see deeply, like
Wordsworth and Emerson and Whitman. But
what the common run of us needs, when we go
a-wooing nature, is not more poetry, but a scientific
course in biology. How a little study in
comparative anatomy, for instance, would reveal
to us the fearful and wonderful in the make-up
of all animal forms! And the fearful and wonderful
have a meaning and a beauty which we
ought to realize.</p>

<p>We all respond to the flowers and birds, for
they demand no mental effort. What about the
snakes and frogs? Do we shiver at them? Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
we more than barely endure them? No one can
help feeling the comfort and sympathy of the
bluebird. The very drifts soften as he appears.
He comes some March morning in a flurry of
snow, or drops down out of a cheerless, soaking
sky, and assures us that he has just left the South
and has hurried ahead at considerable hazard to
tell us that spring is on the way. Yet, here is
another voice, earlier than the bluebird's often,
with the bluebird's message, and with even more
than the bluebird's authority; but who will
listen to a frog? A prophet is not without
honor save in his own country. One must needs
have wings and come from a foreign land to be
received among us as a prophet of the spring.
Suppose a little frog noses his way up through
the stiff, cold mud, bumps against the ice, and
pipes, <i>Spring! spring! spring!</i> Has he not
as much claim upon our faith as a bird that drops
down from no one knows where, with the same
message? The bluebird comes because he has
seen the spring; Hyla comes because he has the
spring in his heart. He that receives Hyla in
the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's
reward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>For me there is no clearer call in all the year
than that of the hylas' in the break-up days of
March. The sap begins to start in my roots at
the first peep. There is something in their brave
little summons, as there is in the silvery light on
the pussy-willows, that takes hold on my hope
and courage, and makes the March mud good to
tramp through. And this despite the fact that
these early hylas so aggravated my first attack
of homesickness that I thought it was to be fatal.
The second night I ever spent away from home
and my mother was passed with old Mrs. Tribbet,
who had a large orchard, behind which was a
frog-pond. In vain did she stay me with raisins
and comfort me with apples. I was sick for
home. And those frogs! When the guineas got
quiet, how dreadful they made the long May
twilight with their shrieking, strangling, homesick
cries! After all these years I cannot listen
to them in the evenings of early spring without
catching an echo from the back of that orchard,
without just a throb of that pain so near to
breaking my heart.</p>

<p>Close by, in a corner lot between the two
cross-roads of the village, lies a wretched little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
puddle, the home of countless hylas until the
June suns dry it up. Among the hundred or
more people who live in the vicinity and who
pass the pond almost daily, I think that I am
the only one who, until recently, was sure he
had ever seen a peeper, and knew that they were
neither tadpoles, salamanders, nor turtles. As
I was standing by the puddle, one May day, a
good neighbor came along and stopped with me.
The chorus was in full blast&mdash;cricket-frogs, Pickering's
frogs, spring frogs, and, leading them all,
the melancholy quaver of Bufo, the "hop-toad."</p>

<p>"What is it that makes the <i>dreadful</i> noise?"
my neighbor asked, meaning, I knew, by "dreadful
noise," the song of the toad. I handed her
my opera-glass, pointed out the minstrel with the
doleful bagpipe sprawling at the surface of the
water, and, after sixty years of wondering, she
saw with immense satisfaction that one part in
this familiar spring medley was taken by the
common toad.</p>

<p>Sixty springs are a good many springs to be
finding out the author of so well-known a sound
as this woeful strain of the serenading toad; but
more than half a century might be spent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
catching a cricket-frog at his song. I tried to
make my neighbor see one that was clinging to
a stick in the middle of the puddle; but her eyes
were dim. Deft hands have dressed these peepers.
We have heard them by the meadowful
every spring of our life, and yet the fingers of
one hand number more than the peepers we have
seen. One day I bent over three lily-pads till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
nearly blind, trying to make out a cricket-frog
that was piping all the while somewhere near or
upon them. At last, in despair, I made a dash
at the pads, only to see the wake as the peeper
sank to the bottom an instant before my net
struck the surface.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;A wretched little puddle.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The entire frog family is as protectively colored
as this least member, the cricket-frog. They
all carry fern-seed in their pockets and go invisible.
Notice the wood-frog with his tan suit and
black cheeks. He is a mere sound as he hops
about over the brown leaves. I have had him
jump out of the way of my feet and vanish while
I stared hard at him. He lands with legs extended,
purposely simulating the shape of the
ragged, broken leaves, and offers, as the only
clue for one's baffled eyes, the moist glisten as
his body dissolves against the dead brown of the
leaf-carpet. The tree-toad, <i>Hyla versicolor</i>, still
more strikingly blends with his surroundings, for,
to a certain extent, he can change color to match
the bark upon which he sits. More than once, in
climbing apple-trees, I have put my hand upon
a tree-toad, not distinguishing it from the patches
of gray-green lichen upon the limbs. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
is less of wonder in the tree-toad's ability to
change his colors than in the way he has of
changing his clothes. He is never troubled
with the getting of a new suit; his labor comes
in caring for his old ones. It is curious how he
disposes of his cast-off clothes.</p>

<p>One day late in autumn I picked up a tree-toad
that was stiff and nearly dead with cold. I
put him in a wide-mouthed bottle to thaw, and
found by evening that he was quite alive, sitting
with his toes turned in, looking much surprised
at his new quarters. He made himself at home,
however, and settled down comfortably, ready
for what might happen next.</p>

<p>The following day he climbed up the side of
the bottle and slept several hours, his tiny disked
toes holding him as easily and restfully as if he
were stretched upon a feather-bed. I turned him
upside down; but he knew nothing of it until
later when he awoke; then he deliberately turned
round with his head up and went to sleep again.
At night he was wide awake, winking and blinking
at the lamp, and watching me through his
window of green glass.</p>

<p>A few nights after his rescue Hyla sat upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
bottom of his bottle in a very queer attitude.
His eyes were drawn in, his head was bent down,
his feet rolled up&mdash;his whole body huddled into
a ball less than half its normal size. After a time
he began to kick and gasp as if in pain, rolling
and unrolling himself desperately. I thought he
was dying. He would double up into a bunch,
then kick out suddenly and stand up on his hind
legs with his mouth wide open as if trying to
swallow something. He <i>was</i> trying to swallow
something, and the thing had stuck on the way.
It was a kind of cord, and ran out of each corner
of his mouth, passing over his front legs, thinning
and disappearing most strangely along his
sides.</p>

<p>With the next gulp I saw the cord slip down
a little, and, as it did so, the skin along his sides
rolled up. It was his old suit! He was taking
it off for a new one; and, instead of giving it to
the poor, he was trying to economize by eating
it. What a meal! What a way to undress!
What curious economy!</p>

<p>Long ago the naturalists told us that the toads
ate their skins&mdash;after shedding them; but it was
never made plain to me that they ate them <i>while</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
changing them&mdash;indeed, <i>swallowed</i> them off!
Three great gulps more and the suit&mdash;shirt,
shoes, stockings, and all&mdash;disappeared. Then
Hyla winked, drew his clean sleeve across his
mouth, and settled back with the very air of one
who has magnificently sent away the waiter with
the change.</p>

<p>Four days later Hyla ate up this new suit. I
saw the entire operation this time. It was almost
a case of surgery. He pulled the skin over
his head and neck with his fore feet as if it were
a shirt, then crammed it into his mouth; kicked
it over his back next; worked out his feet and
legs, then ate it off as before. The act was accomplished
with difficulty, and would have been
quite impossible had not Hyla found the most
extraordinary of tongues in his head. Next to
the ability to speak Russian with the tongue
comes the power to skin one's self with it. The
tree-toad cannot quite croak Russian, but he can
skin himself with his tongue. Unlike ours, his
tongue is hung at the front end, with the free
end forked and pointing toward his stomach.
When my little captive had crammed his mouth
full of skin, he stuck this fork of a tongue into it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and forced it down his throat and held it down
while he kicked and squirmed out of it.</p>

<p>Though less beautifully clothed than Hyla, our
common toad, Bufo, is just as carefully clothed.
Where the rain drips from the eaves, clean,
narrow lines of pebbles have been washed out of
the lawn. On one side of the house the shade
lies all day long and the grass is cool and damp.
Here, in the shade, a large toad has lived for two
summers. I rarely pass that way without seeing
him, well hidden in the grass. For several days
lately he had been missing, when, searching more
closely one morning, I found him sunk to the
level of his back in the line of pebbles, his spots
and the glands upon his neck so mingling with
the varied collection of gravel about him that
only a practised eye, and that sharp with expectation,
could have made him out.</p>

<p>In a newly plowed field, with some of the fresh
soil sticking to him, what thing could look more
like a clod than this brown, shapeless lump of a
toad? But there is a beauty even in this unlovely
form; for here is perfect adaptability.</p>

<p>Our canons of the beautiful are false if they
do not in some way include the toad. Shall we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
measure all the out-of-doors by the linnet's song,
the cardinal-flower's flame, and the hay-field's
odor? Deeper, wider, more fundamental and
abiding than these standards, lie the intellectual
principles of plan and purpose and the intellectual
quality of perfect execution. We shall love
not alone with all our heart, but with all our
mind as well. If we judge the world beautiful
by the superficial standard of what happens to
please our eye, we shall see no more of the world
than we do of the new moon. Whole classes of
animals and wide regions of the earth's surface
must, by this test, be excluded. The only way
the batrachians could possibly come in would
be by rolling the frogs in bread-crumbs and frying
them. Treated thus, they look good and
taste good, but this is all that can be said for the
entire family. Studied, however, from the single
view-point of protective coloring, or again, as
illustrating the ease with which the clumsiest
forms can be fitted to the widest variety of conditions,
the toads do not suffer by any comparison.
In the light of such study, Bufo loses his
repulsiveness and comes to have a place quite as
unique as the duckbill's, and a personality not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
less fascinating than the swallow's or the gray
squirrel's.</p>

<p>However, the toad to the most of us is anything
but a poem. What, indeed, looks less lovely, less
nimble and buoyant, more chained to the earth,
than a toad? But stretch the least web between
his toes, lengthen his hind legs, and&mdash;over he
goes, the leopard-frog, champion high diver of
the marsh! Or, instead of the web, tip his toes
with the tiniest disks, and&mdash;there he swings,
Pickering's little hyla, clinging as easily to the
under surface of that oak-leaf high in the tree as
a fly clings to the kitchen ceiling.</p>

<p>When a boy I climbed to the top of the flagpole
on one of the State geological survey stations.
The pole rose far above the surrounding
pines&mdash;the highest point for miles around. As
I clinched the top of the staff, gripping my fingers
into the socket for the flag-stick, I felt
something cold, and drawing myself up, found a
tree-toad asleep in the hole. Under him was a
second toad, and under the second a third&mdash;all
dozing up here on the very topmost tip of all
the region.</p>

<p>From the river-ooze to the tree-top, nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
carries this toad-form simply by a thin web between
the toes, or by tiny disks at their tips.
And mixing her greens and browns with just a
dash of yellow, she paints them all so skilfully
that, upon a lily-pad, beside a lump of clay, or
against the lichened limb of an old apple-tree,
each sits as securely as Perseus in the charmed
helmet that made him invisible.</p>

<p>The frogs have innumerable enemies among
the water-birds, the fish, the snakes, and such
animals as the fisher, coon, possum, and mink.
The toads fortunately are supplied with glands
behind their heads whose secretion is hateful to
most of their foes, though it seems to be no
offense whatever to the snakes. A toad's only
chance, when a snake is after him, lies in hiding.
I once saw a race between a toad and an adder
snake, however, in which the hopper won.</p>

<p>One bright May morning I was listening to the
music of the church bells, as it floated out from
the city and called softly over the fields, when
my reverie was interrupted by a sharp squeak
and a thud beside the log on which I sat; something
dashed over my foot; and I turned to
catch sight of a toad bouncing past the log, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
hard for the brush along the fence. He
scarcely seemed to touch the ground, but
skimmed over the grass as if transformed into a
midget jack-rabbit. His case was urgent; and
little wonder! At the opposite end of the log,
raised four or five inches from the grass, her eyes
hard glittering, her nose tilted in the air, and
astonishment all over her face, swayed the flat,
ugly head of a hognose-adder. Evidently she,
too, had never seen a toad get away in any such
time before; and after staring a moment, she
turned under the log and withdrew from the
race, beaten.</p>

<p>Hungry snakes and hot, dusty days are death
to the toads. Bufo would almost as soon find
himself at the bottom of a well as upon a dusty
road in blazing sunshine. His day is the night.
He is not particular about the moon. All he
asks is that the night be warm, that the dew lay
the dust and dampen the grass, and that the insects
be out in numbers. At night the snakes are
asleep, and so are most of those ugly, creaking
beasts with rolling iron feet that come crushing
along their paths. There is no foe abroad at
night, and life, during these dark, quiet hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
has even for a toad something like a dash of
gaiety.</p>

<p>In one of the large pastures not far away
stands a pump. It is shaded by an ancient
apple-tree, under which, when the days are
hottest, the cattle gather to doze and dream.
They have worn away the grass about the mossy
trough, and the water, slopping over, keeps the
spot cool and muddy the summer through. Here
the toads congregate from every quarter of the
great field. I stretched myself out flat on the
grass one night and watched them in the moonlight.
There must have been fifty here that
night, hopping about over the wet place&mdash;as
grotesque a band as ever met by woods or waters.</p>

<p>We need no "second sight," no pipe of Pan,
no hills of Latmos with a flock to feed, to find
ourselves back in that enchanted world of the
kelpies and satyrs. All we need to do is to use
the eyes and ears we have, and haunt our hills
by morning and by moonlight. Here in the
moonlight around the old pump I saw goblins,
if ever goblins were seen in the light of our
moon.</p>

<p>There was not a croak, not a squeak, not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
slightest sound, save the small <i>pit-pat, pit-pat</i>,
made by their hopping. There may have been
some kind of toad talk among them, but listen
never so closely, I could not catch a syllable
of it.</p>

<p>Where did they all come from? How did
they find their way to this wet spot over the
hills and across the acres of this wide pasture?
You could walk over the field in the daytime
and have difficulty in finding a single toad; but
here at night, as I lay watching, every few minutes
one would hop past me in the grass; or
coming down the narrow cow-paths in the faint
light I could see a wee black bunch bobbing
leisurely along with a hop and a stop, moving
slowly toward the pump to join the band of his
silent friends under the trough.</p>

<p>Not because there was more food at the pump,
nor for the joy of gossip, did the toads meet here.
The one thing necessary to their existence is
water, and doubtless many of these toads had
crossed this pasture of fifteen acres simply to get
a drink. I have known a toad to live a year
without food, and another to die in three days
for lack of water. And yet this thirsty little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
beast never knows the pleasure of a real drink,
because he does not know how to drink.</p>

<p>I have kept toads confined in cages for weeks
at a time, never allowing them water when I
could not watch them closely, and I never saw
one drink. Instead, they would sprawl out in
the saucer on their big, expansive bellies, and
<i>soak</i> themselves full, as they did here on the
damp sand about the pump.</p>

<p>Just after sunset, when the fireflies light up and
the crickets and katydids begin to chirp, the toad
that sleeps under my front step hops out of bed,
kicks the sand off his back, and takes a long look
at the weather. He seems to <i>think</i> as he sits
here on the gravel walk, sober and still, with
his face turned skyward. What does he think
about? Is he listening to the chorus of the
crickets, to the whippoorwills, or is it for supper
he is planning? It may be of the vicissitudes of
toad life, and of the mutability of all sublunary
things, that he meditates. Who knows? Some
day perhaps we shall have a batrachian psychology,
and I shall understand what it is that my
door-step lodger turns over and over in his mind
as he watches the coming of the stars. All I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
do now is to minute his cogitations, and I remember
one evening when he sat thinking and winking
a full hour without making a single hop.</p>

<p>As the darkness comes down he makes off for
a night of bug-hunting. At the first peep of
dawn, bulging plump at the sides, he turns back
for home. Home to a toad usually means any
place that offers sleep and safety for the day;
but if undisturbed, like the one under the step,
he will return to the same spot throughout the
summer. This chosen spot may be the door-step,
the cracks between the bricks of a well, or the
dense leaves of a strawberry bed.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1899 so very little rain fell
between March and June that I had to water
my cucumber-hills. There was scarcely a morning
during this dry spell that I did not find several
toads tucked away for the day in these moist
hills. These individuals had no regular home,
like the one under the step, but hunted up the
coolest, shadiest places in the soft soil and made
new beds for themselves every morning.</p>

<p>Their bed-making is very funny, but not
likely to meet the approval of the housewife.
Wearied with the night's hunting, a toad comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to the cool cucumber-vines and proceeds at once
to kick himself into bed. He backs and kicks
and elbows into the loose sand as far as he can,
then screws and twists till he is worked out of
sight beneath the soil, hind end foremost. Here
he lies, with only his big pop-eyes sticking out,
half asleep, half awake. If a hungry adder
crawls along, he simply pulls in his eyes, the
loose sand falls over them, and the snake
passes on.</p>

<p>When the nights begin to grow chilly and
there are threatenings of frost, the toads hunt up
winter quarters, and hide deep down in some
warm burrow&mdash;till to-morrow if the sun comes
out hot, or, it may be, not to wake until next
April. Sometimes an unexpected frost catches
them, when any shelter must do, when even their
snake-fear is put aside or forgotten. "Misery
acquaints a man with strange bedfellows," said
Trinculo, as he crawled in with Caliban from the
storm. So might the toad say in an early frost.</p>

<p>The workmen in a sandstone-quarry near by
dug out a bunch of toads one winter, all mixed
up with a bunch of adders. They were wriggled
and squirmed together in a perfect jumble of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
legs, heads, and tails&mdash;all in their dead winter
sleep. Their common enemy, the frost, had
taken them unawares, and driven them like
friends into the crevice of the rocks, where they
would have slept together until the spring had
not the quarrymen unearthed them.</p>

<p>There is much mystery shrouding this humble
batrachian. Somewhere in everybody's imagination
is a dark cell harboring a toad. Reading
down through literature, it is astonishing how
often the little monster has hopped into it.
There is chance for some one to make a big book
of the fable and folk-lore that has been gathering
through the ages about the toads. The stories
of the jewels in their heads, of their age-long entombments
in the rocks, of the warts and spells
they induce, of their eating fire and dropping
from the clouds, are legion.</p>

<p>And there seems to be some basis of fact for
all these tales. No one has yet written for us
the life-history of the toad. After having
watched the tadpole miracle, one is thoroughly
prepared to see toads jump out of the fire, tumble
from broken marble mantles, and fall from the
clouds. I never caught them in my hat during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
a shower; but I have stood on Mauricetown
Bridge, when the big drops came pelting down,
and seen those drops apparently turn into tiny
toads as they struck the planks, until the bridge
was alive with them! Perhaps they had been
hiding from the heat between the cracks of the
planks&mdash;but there are people who believe that
they came down from the clouds.</p>

<p>How, again, shall I explain this bit of observation?
More than six years I lived near a mudhole
that dried up in July. I passed it almost
daily. One spring there was a strange toad-call
in the hole, a call that I had never heard anything
like before&mdash;a deafening, agonizing roar,
hoarse and woeful. I found on investigation that
the water was moving with spade-foot toads.
Two days later the hole was still; every toad
was gone. They disappeared; and though I
kept that little puddle under watch for several
seasons after that, I have not known a spade-foot
to appear there since.</p>

<p>The water was almost jellied with their spawn,
and a little later was swarming with spade-foot
tadpoles. Then it began to dry up, and some of
the tadpoles were left stranded in the deep foot-prints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of the cows along the edge of the hole.
Just as fast as the water disappeared in these
foot-prints, the tails of the tadpoles were absorbed
and legs formed, and they hopped away&mdash;some
of them a week before their brothers,
that were hatched at the same time, but who
had stayed in the middle of the pond, where the
deeper water allowed them a longer babyhood
for the use of their tails. So swiftly, under pressure,
can nature work with this adaptable body
of the toad!</p>

<p>Long before the sun-baked mud began to
crack these young ones had gone&mdash;where? And
whence came their parents, and whither went
they? When will they return?</p>

<p>In your woods walks did you ever notice a
little furrow or tunnel through the underbrush,
a tiny roadway in the briers and huckleberry-bushes?
Did you ever try to follow this
path to its beginning or end, wondering who
traveled it? You have, doubtless. But the
woods must be wild and the undergrowth thick
and you must be as much at home among the
trees as you are in your own dooryard, else this
slight mark will make no impression upon you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>But enter any wild tract of wood or high
swamp along the creek, and look sharp as you cut
across the undergrowth. You will not go far
before finding a narrow runway under your feet.
It is about five inches wide, leading in no particular
direction, and is evidently made by cutting
off the small stems of vines and bushes at an inch
or more from the ground. The work looks as if
it had been laid out by rule and done with a
sharp knife, it is so regular and clean.</p>

<p>This is a rabbit road. Follow it a few rods
and you will find it crossed by another road, exactly
similar. Take this new path now, and
soon you are branching off, turning, and joining
other roads. You are in rabbit-land, traveling
its highways&mdash;the most complicated and entangling
system of thoroughfares that was ever constructed.
The individual roads are straight
and plain enough, but at a glance one can
see that the plan of the system is intended to
bewilder and lead astray all who trespass here.
Without a map and directions no one could
hope to arrive at any definite point through
such a snarl.</p>

<p>There often comes along with the circus a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
building called the "Moorish Maze," over whose
entrance is this invitation:</p>

<p class="center">
COME IN AND GET LOST!<br />
</p>

<p>This is what one reads at the cross-roads in
rabbit-land. There are finger-boards and milestones
along the way; but they point nowhere
and mark no distances except to the rabbits.</p>

<p>An animal's strong points usually supplement
each other; its well-developed powers are in line
with its needs and mode of life. So, by the very
demands of his peculiar life, the beaver has become
chief among all the animal engineers, his
specialty being dams. He can make a good slide
for logging, but of the construction of speedways
he knows absolutely nothing. The rabbit, on
the other hand, is a runner. He can swim if he
is obliged to. His interests, however, lie mostly
in his heels, and hence in his highways. So
Bunny has become an expert road-maker. He
cannot build a house, nor dig even a respectable
den; he is unable to climb, and his face is too
flat for hole-gnawing: but turn him loose in a
brambly, briery wilderness, and he will soon
thread the trackless waste with a network of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
roads, and lay it open to his nimble feet as the
sky lies open to the swallow's wings.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i044.jpg" width="400" height="219" alt="dog chasing rabbit" title="dog chasing rabbit" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Calamity is hot on his track.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>But how maddening these roads are to the
dogs and foxes! In the first place, they have a
peculiar way of beginning nowhere in particular,
and of vanishing all at once, in the same blind
fashion. I am not sure that I ever found a satisfactory
end to a rabbit's road&mdash;that is, a nest, a
playground, or even a feeding-place. Old Calamity,
the hound, is always tormented and
undone whenever she runs foul of a rabbit
road.</p>

<p>She will start Bunny in the open field, and trail
away after him in full tongue as fast as her fat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
bow-legs will carry her. The rabbit makes for
the woods. Calamity is hot on his track, going
down toward the creek. Suddenly she finds
herself plunging along a rabbit road, breaking
her way through by sheer force where the rabbit
slipped along with perfect ease. She is following
the path now rather than the scent, and, all at
once, discovers that she is off the trail. She
turns and goes back. Yes, here the rabbit made
a sharp break to the right by a side-path; the
track is fresh and warm, and the old hound sings
in her eager delight. On she goes with more
haste, running the path again instead of the
trail, and&mdash;there is no path! It is gone. This
bothers the old dog; but her nose is keen and
she has picked up the course again. Here it goes
into another road. She gives tongue again, and
rushes on, when&mdash;<i>Wow!</i> she has plunged into a
thick and thorny tangle of greenbrier.</p>

<p>That is where the torment comes in. These
roads have a habit of taking in the brier-patches.
Calamity will go round a patch if she can; she
will work her way through if she must&mdash;but it is
at the cost of bloody ears and a thousand smarting
pricks. Bunny, meantime, is watching just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
inside the next brier-patch, counting the digs of
his clumsy pursuer.</p>

<p>I suppose that this "blind alley" kind of road
is due to the fact that the rabbits have no regular
homes. They make a nest for the young;
but they never have dens, like minks and coons.
In New England they often live in holes and
among the crannies of the stone walls; and there,
as far as I have seen, they rarely or never make
roads. Farther south, where the winters are
less severe, they dig no holes, for they prefer an
open, even an exposed, bed to any sort of shelter.</p>

<p>Shelters are dangerous. Bunny cannot back
into a burrow and bare his teeth to his enemy;
he is not a fighter. He can run, and he knows
it; legs are his salvation, and he must have room
to limber them. If he has to fight, then give
him the open, not a hole; for it is to be a kangaroo
kicking match, and a large ring is needed.
He had as well surrender himself at once as to
run into a hole that has only one opening.</p>

<p>During the cold, snowy weather the rabbits
usually leave the bare fields for the woods,
though the older and wiser ones more frequently
suffer the storms than risk the greater danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of such a move. When pressed by hunger or
hounded hard, they often take to a rail-pile, and
sometimes they grow so bold as to seek hiding
under a barn or house. One young buck lived
all winter in the wood-pile of one of my neighbors,
becoming so tame that he fed with the
chickens.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Bunny, meantime, is watching just inside the next brier-patch.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The nearest approach that a rabbit makes to
a house is his "squat," or form. This is simply a
sitting-place in the fields or along the woods, that
he will change every time he is thoroughly frightened
out of it. Undisturbed he will stay in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
squat for months at a time. Occasionally a rabbit
will have two or three squats located over his
range, each one so placed that a wide view on
every side may be had. If it is along the woods,
then he sits facing the open fields, with his
ears laid back toward the trees. He can hear as
far as he can see, and his nose tells him who is
coming up the wind sooner than either eyes or
ears.</p>

<p>It is cold, lonely living here in the winter.
But everybody, except the mice and little birds,
are enemies, his only friends being his wits
and legs. In the long run, wits and legs are
pretty safe insurance. "He who fights and runs
away will live to fight another day," is Bunny's
precept&mdash;and it works well; he still thrives.</p>

<p>The squat is a cold place. The sky is its roof,
and its only protection is the tuft of grass, the
stone, or the stump beside which it is placed.
Bunny may change to the lee or windward side,
as suits him, during a storm; but usually he
keeps his place and lies close to the ground, no
matter how the wind blows, or how fiercely falls
the rain and snow. I have frequently started
them from their squats in bleak, wind-swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
fields, when the little brown things were completely
snowed under.</p>

<p>There is great individuality among all animals,
and though the rabbits look as much alike as
peas, they are no exception to the rule. This
personality is especially shown in their whimsical
fancies for certain squats. Here, within sight of
the house and the dog, an old rabbit took up her
abode on a big, flat rail in the corner of the
fence. Of course no hawk or owl could touch
her here, for they dared not swoop between
the rails; the dog and cat could scent her,
but she had already whipped the cat, and
she had given Calamity so many long runs
that the hound was weary of her. The strategic
value of such a situation is plain: she was
thus raised just above the level of the field and
commanded every approach. Perhaps it was not
whim, but wisdom, that led to this selection.</p>

<p>I knew another, a dwarf rabbit, that always
got into a bare or plowed field and squatted beside
a brown stone or clod of earth. Experience
had taught him that he looked like a clod, and
that no enemy ever plagued him when he lay
low in the brown soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>One summer I stumbled upon a squat close
along the public road. Cart-loads of trash had
been dumped there, and among the debris was a
bottomless coal-scuttle. In the coal-scuttle a
rabbit made his squat. Being open at both ends,
it sheltered him beautifully from sun and rain.
Here he sat, napping through the day, watching
the interesting stream of passers-by, himself
hidden by the rank weeds and grass. When discovered
by a dog or boy, he tripped out of one
of his open doors and led the intruder a useless
run into the swamp.</p>

<p>At one time my home was separated from the
woods by only a clover-field. This clover-field
was a favorite feeding-ground for the rabbits of
the vicinity. Here, in the early evening, they
would gather to feed and frolic; and, not content
with clover, they sometimes went into the garden
for a dessert of growing corn and young cabbage.</p>

<p>Take a moonlight night in autumn and hide
in the edge of these woods. There is to be a rabbit
party in the clover-field. The grass has long
been cut and the field is clean and shining; but
still there is plenty to eat. The rabbits from
both sides of the woods are coming. The full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
moon rises above the trees, and the cottontails
start over. Now, of course, they use the paths
which they cut so carefully the longest possible
way round. They hop leisurely along, stopping
now and then to nibble the sassafras bark or to
get a bite of wintergreen, even quitting the path,
here and there, for a berry or a bunch of sweet
wood-grass.</p>

<p>"Stop a moment; this won't do! Here is a side-path
where the briers have grown three inches
since they were last cut off. This path must be
cleared out at once," and the old buck falls to cutting.
By the time he has finished the path a dozen
rabbits have assembled in the clover-field. When
he appears there is a <i>thump</i>, and all look up; some
one runs to greet the new-comer; they touch
whiskers and smell, then turn to their eating.</p>

<p>The feast is finished, and the games are on.
Four or five of the rabbits have come together
for a turn at hop-skip-and-jump. And such hop-skip-and-jump!
They are professionals at this
sport, every one of them. There is not a rabbit
in the game that cannot leap five times higher
than he can reach on his tiptoes, and hop a clean
ten feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">&quot;The limp, lifeless one hanging over the neck of that fox.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>Over and over they go, bounding and bouncing,
snapping from their marvelous hind legs as
if shot from a spring-trap. It is the greatest
jumping exhibition that you will ever see. To
have such legs as these is the next best thing to
having wings.</p>

<p>Right in the thick of the fun sounds a sharp
<i>thump! thump!</i> Every rabbit "freezes." It is
the stamp of an old buck, the call, <i>Danger!
danger!</i> He has heard a twig break in the woods,
or has seen a soft, shadowy thing cross the moon.</p>

<p>As motionless as stumps squat the rabbits, stiff
with the tenseness of every ready muscle. They
listen. But it was only a dropping nut or a restless
bird; and the play continues.</p>

<p>They are chasing each other over the grass in
a game of tag. There go two, round and round,
tagging and re-tagging, first one being "it" and
then the other. Their circle widens all the time
and draws nearer to the woods. This time round
they will touch the bush behind which we are
watching. Here they come&mdash;there they go;
they will leap the log yonder. Flash! squeak!
scurry! Not a rabbit in the field! Yes; one
rabbit&mdash;the limp, lifeless one hanging over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
neck of that fox trotting off yonder in the
shadows, along the border of the woods!</p>

<p>The picnic is over for this night, and it will be
some time before the cottontails so far forget
themselves as to play in this place again.</p>

<p>It is small wonder that animals do not laugh.
They have so little play. The savage seldom
laughs, for he hunts and is hunted like a wild
animal, and is allowed so scant opportunity to be
off guard that he cannot develop the power to
laugh. Much more is this true of the animals.
From the day an animal is born, instinct and
training are bent toward the circumvention of
enemies. There is no time to play, no chance,
no cause for laughter.</p>

<p>The little brown rabbit has least reason of all
to be glad. He is utterly inoffensive, the enemy
of none, but the victim of many. Before he
knows his mother he understands the meaning of
<i>Be ready! Watch!</i> He drinks these words in
with his milk. The winds whisper them; the
birds call them; every leaf, every twig, every
shadow and sound, says: <i>Be ready! Watch!</i>
Life is but a series of escapes, little else than
vigilance and flight. He must sleep with eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
open, feed with ears up, move with muffled feet,
and, at short stages, he must stop, rise on his
long hind legs, and listen and look. If he ever
forgets, if he pauses one moment for a wordless,
noiseless game with his fellows, he dies. For
safety's sake he lives alone; but even a rabbit
has fits of sociability, and gives way at times to
his feelings. The owl and the fox know this,
and they watch the open glades and field-edges.
They must surprise him.</p>

<p>The barred owl is quick at dodging, but Bunny
is quicker. It is the owl's soft, shadow-silent
wings that are dreaded. They spirit him
through the dusk like a huge moth, wavering
and aimless, with dangling dragon-claws. But
his drop is swift and certain, and the grip of
those loosely hanging legs is the very grip of
death. There is no terror like the ghost-terror
of the owl.</p>

<p>The fox is feared; but then, he is on legs, not
wings, and there are telltale winds that fly before
him, far ahead, whispering, <i>Fox, fox, fox!</i>
The owl, remember, like the wind, has wings&mdash;wings
that are faster than the wind's, and the
latter cannot get ahead to tell of his coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Reynard is cunning. Bunny is fore-sighted, wide
awake, and fleet of foot. Sometimes he is caught
napping&mdash;so are we all; but if in wits he is not
always Reynard's equal, in speed he holds his
own very well with his enemy. Reynard is
nimble, but give the little cottontail a few feet
handicap in a race for life, and he stands a fair
chance of escape, especially in the summer woods.</p>

<p>When the hounds are on his trail the rabbit
saves his legs by outwitting his pursuers. He
will win a long distance ahead of them, and before
they overtake him he will double on his
track, approaching as near as he dare to the
dogs, then leap far aside upon a log, into a stream,
or among the bushes, and strike out in a new
direction, gradually making back toward the
starting-place. He rises on his haunches to listen,
as he goes along, and before the dogs have again
picked up the trail, he has perhaps had time to
rest and lunch.</p>

<p>If it were a matter of dogs only, life would be
just full enough of excitement to be interesting.
He can double, balk, and mix trails on them, and
enjoy it. They are nothing to fool. But the
gun! Ah, that's a foe which he cannot get up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">&nbsp;</a></span>
with. He may double and confuse the dogs;
but as he comes back along a side-road, with
them yelping far in the rear, he often hops right
into a game-bag.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i048.jpg" width="400" height="532" alt="owl dropping" title="owl dropping" />
<span class="caption">&quot;His drop is swift and certain.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>To do justice to the intelligence of the dog,
and to be truthful about the rabbit, it must be
remembered that, in the chase, Bunny usually
has the advantage of knowing the lay of the land.
The short cuts, streams, logs, briers, and roads
are all in mind before he takes a jump. The
dog is often on strange ground. Free the rabbit
for the hunt, as you do the fox, on unknown
territory, and the dogs will soon take the frightened,
bewildered little creature.</p>

<p>There is no braver or more devoted mother
in all the wilds than Molly Cottontail. She has
a mother's cunning and a mother's resourcefulness,
also. But this is to be expected. If number
of children count for experience, then, surely,
Molly ought to be resourceful. There are seasons
when she will raise as many as three families&mdash;and
old-fashioned families for size, too.
It is not uncommon to find ten young rabbits
in a nest. Five times twins! And all to be
fed, washed, and kept covered up in bed together!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
But animal children, as a rule, behave
better than human children, so we may not measure
the task of Mother Molly by any standard
of our own. It is task enough, however, since
you can scarcely count the creatures that eat
young rabbits, nor the enemies that unwittingly
destroy them. A heavy rain may drown them,
cattle may crush them, mowing-machines may
cut them to pieces, and boys who are starting
menageries may carry them away to starve.</p>

<p>Molly's mother-wit and craft are sufficient for
most of these things. She picks out a sunny
hillside among high grasses and bushes for the
nest, so that the rain will flow off and not flood
it, and because that here the cows are not so
likely to trample, nor the plow and mowing-machine
to come. She must also have ready and
hidden access to the nest, which the grass and
bushes afford.</p>

<p>She digs a little hollow in the sand about a foot
deep and as big around as a duck's nest, lines it
first with coarse grasses and leaves, then with a
layer of finer grass, and fills the whole with
warm, downy fur plucked from her own sides
and breast. This nest, not being situated at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
end of an inaccessible burrow, like the tame
rabbit's or woodchuck's, requires that all care be
taken to conceal every sign of it. The raw sand
that is thrown out is artfully covered with leaves
and grass to blend with the surrounding ground;
and over the nest itself I have seen the old rabbit
pull vines and leaves until the inquisitive, nosing
skunk would have passed it by.</p>

<p>Molly keeps the young ones in this bed for
about two weeks, after which time, if frightened,
they will take to their heels. They are exceedingly
tender at this age and ought not to be
allowed to run out. They do not know what a
man is, and hardly understand what their hind
legs are. I saw one that was at least a month
old jump up before a mowing-machine and bolt
across the field. It was his first real scare, and
the first time that he had been called upon to
test his legs. It was funny. He didn't know
how to use them. He made some tremendous
leaps, and was so unused to the powerful spring
in his hind feet that he turned several complete
somersaults in the air.</p>

<p>Molly feeds the family shortly after nightfall,
and always tucks them in when leaving, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
caution to lie quiet and still. She is not often
surprised with her young, but lingers near on
guard. You can easily tell if you are in the
neighborhood of her nest by the way she thumps
and watches you, and refuses to be driven off.
Here she waits, and if anything smaller than a
dog appears she rushes to meet it, stamping the
ground in fury. A dog she will intercept by
leaving a warm trail across his path, or, in case
the brute has no nose for her scent, by throwing
herself in front of him and drawing him off on a
long chase.</p>

<p>One day, as I was quietly picking wild strawberries
on a hill, I heard a curious grunting down
the side below me, then the quick <i>thud! thud!</i> of
an angry rabbit. Among the bushes I caught
a glimpse of rabbit ears. A fight was on.</p>

<p>Crouching beside a bluish spot, which I knew
to be a rabbit's nest, was a big yellow cat. He
had discovered the young ones, and was making
mouths at the thought of how they would taste,
when the mother's thump startled him. He
squatted flat, with ears back, tail swelled, and
hair standing up along his back, as the rabbit
leaped over him. It was a glimpse of Molly's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
ears, as she made the jump, that I had caught.
It was the beginning of the bout&mdash;only a feint
by the rabbit, just to try the mettle of her antagonist.</p>

<p>The cat was scared, and before he got himself
together, Molly, with a mighty bound, was in
the air again, and, as she flashed over him, she
fetched him a stunning whack on the head that
knocked him endwise. He was on his feet in an
instant, but just in time to receive a stinging
blow on the ear that sent him sprawling several
feet down the hill. The rabbit seemed constantly
in the air. Back and forth, over and over the
cat she flew, and with every bound landed a
terrific kick with her powerful hind feet, that
was followed by a puff of yellow fur.</p>

<p>The cat could not stand up to this. Every
particle of breath and fight was knocked out of
him at about the third kick. The green light in
his eyes was the light of terror. He got quickly
to a bush, and ran away, else I believe that the
old rabbit would have beaten him to death.</p>

<p>The seven young ones in the nest were unharmed.
Molly grunted and stamped at me for
looking at them; but I was too big to kick as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
had just kicked the cat, and I could not be led
away to chase her, as she would have led a dog.
The little fellows were nearly ready to leave the
nest. A few weeks later, when the wheat was
cut in the field above, one of the seven was killed
by the long, fearful knife of the reaper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>Perhaps the other six survived until November,
the beginning of the gunning season. But
when the slaughter was past, if one lived, he remembered
more than once the cry of the hounds,
the crack of the gun, and the sting of shot. He
has won a few months' respite from his human
enemies; but this is not peace. There is no
peace for him. He may escape a long time yet;
but his foes are too many for him. He fights a
good fight, but must lose at last.</p>

<h2><a name="SECOND_CROPS" id="SECOND_CROPS"></a>SECOND CROPS</h2>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p>Take it the year round, the deadest trees in
the woods are the livest and fullest of fruit&mdash;for
the naturalist. Dr. Holmes had a passion
for big trees; the camera-carriers hunt up historic
trees; boys with deep pockets take to fruit-trees:
but dead trees, since I developed a curiosity
for dark holes, have yielded me the most and
largest crops.</p>

<p>An ardor for decayed trees is not from any
perversity of nature. There is nothing unreasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
in it, as in&mdash;bibliomania, for instance.
I discover a gaunt, punky old pine, bored full of
holes, and standing among acres of green, characterless
companions, with the held breath, the
jumping pulse, the bulging eyes of a collector
stumbling upon a Caxton in a latest-publication
book-store. But my excitement is really with
some cause; for&mdash;sh! look! In that round
hole up there, just under the broken limb, the
flame of the red-headed woodpecker&mdash;a light in
one of the windows of the woods. Peep through
it. What rooms! What people! No; I never
paid ten cents extra for a volume because it was
full of years and mildew and rare errata (I sometimes
buy books at a reduction for these accidents);
but I have walked miles, and passed
forests of green, good-looking trees, to wait in
the slim shade of some tottering, limbless old
stump.</p>

<p>Within the reach of my landscape four of these
ancient derelicts hold their stark arms against
the horizon, while every wood-path, pasture-lane,
and meadow-road leads past hollow apples,
gums, or chestnuts, where there are sure to be
happenings as the seasons come and go. Sooner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
or later, every dead tree in the neighborhood
finds a place in my note-book. They are all
named and mentioned, some over and over,&mdash;my
list of Immortals,&mdash;all very dead or very hollow,
ranging from a big sweet-gum in the swamp
along the creek to an old pump-tree, stuck for a
post within fifty feet of my window. The gum
is the hollowest, the pump the deadest, tree of
the lot.</p>

<p>The nozle-hole of the one-time pump stares
hard at my study window like the empty socket
of a Cyclops. There is a small bird-house nailed
just above the window, which gazes back with its
single eye at the staring pump. For some time
one April the sputtering sparrows held this box
above the window against the attacks of two tree-swallows.
The sparrows had been on the ground
all winter, and had staked their claim with a nest
that had already outgrown the house when the
swallows arrived. In love of fair play, and remembering
more than one winter day made alive
and cheerful by the sparrows, I could not interfere
and oust them, though it grieved me to lose
the pretty pair of swallows as summer neighbors.</p>

<p>The swallows disappeared. All was quiet for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a few days, when, one morning, I saw the flutter
of steel-blue wings at the hole in the pump, and
there, propped hard with his tail over the hole,
hung my tree-swallow. I should have that pair
as tenants yet, and in a house where I could
see everything they did. He peered quickly
around, then peeped cautiously into the opening,
and slipped out of sight through the dark, round
hole.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i051.jpg" width="400" height="389" alt="checks out nest" title="checks out nest" />
<span class="caption">&quot;I knew it suited
exactly.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>I knew it suited exactly by the glad, excited
way he came out and darted off. He soon returned
with the little shining wife; and through
a whole week there was a constant passing of
blue backs and white breasts as the joyous pair
fitted up the inside of that pump with grass and
feathers fit for the cradle of a fairy queen.</p>

<p>By the rarest fortune I was on hand when one
of the sparrows discovered what had happened
in the pump. There is not a single microbe of
Anglophobia in my system. But need one's love
for things English include this pestiferous sparrow?
Anyhow, I feel just a mite of satisfaction
when I recall how that sparrow, with the colonizing
instinct of his race, dropping down upon
the pump with the notion that he "had a duty
to the world," dropped off that pump straightway,
concluding that his "duty" did not relate
to that particular pump any longer. The sparrows
had built everywhere about the place, but
that that pump&mdash;a post, and a post to a pair of
bars at that&mdash;was worth settling had not dawned
on them. When they saw that the swallows had
taken it, one of them lighted there instantly,
with tail up, head cocked, very much amazed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
commenting vociferously. He
looked into the hole from every
possible point, and was about
to enter, when there came a
whizz of wings, a flash of blue,
and a slap that sent him spinning.
When the indignant swallow
low swooped back, like a
boomerang, the sparrow had
scuttled off to an apple-tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 100px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;With tail up, head

amazed, and commenting
vociferously.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>That was a <i>coup de grâce</i>.
Peace reigned after that; and
along in July the five white
eggs had found wings and were
skimming about the fly-filled air
or counting and preening themselves
demurely in a solemn row
upon the wire fence.</p>

<p>Between two pastures, easily
seen from the same study window,
stands a wild apple-tree,
pathetically diseased and rheumatic,
which, like one of Mr. Burroughs's trees,
never bore very good crops of apples, but
four seasons a year is marvelously full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
animals. It is chiefly noted for a strange
collection I once took out of its maw-like
cavity.</p>

<p>It was a keen January morning, and I stopped
at the tree, as usual, and thumped. No lodgers
there that day, it seemed. I mounted the rail
fence and looked in. Darkness. No; there at
the bottom was a patch of gray, and&mdash;I pulled
out a snapping, blinking screech-owl. Down
went my hand again, and a second owl came
blinking to the light&mdash;this one in rich brown
plumage. When I turned him up, his clenched
claws held fistfuls of possum hair. Once more
I pushed my hand down the hole, gingerly, and
up to the shoulder. No mistake. Mr. Possum
was in there, and after a little man&oelig;uvering I
seized him by the collar, and out he came grinning,
hissing, and winking at the hard, white
winter day.</p>

<p>And how exactly like a possum! "There is a
time for all things," comes near an incarnation
in him. There is a time for eating owls&mdash;at
night, of course, if owls can then be had. But
day is the time to sleep; and if owls want to
share his bed and roost upon him, all right. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
<i>will</i> sleep on till nightfall, in spite of owls. And
he would sleep on here till dusk, in spite of my
rude awakening, if I gave him leave. I dropped
him back to the bottom of the hole, then put the
two owls back upon him, and went my way,
knowing I should find the three still sleeping on
my return. And it was so. The owls were just
as surprised and just as sleepy when I disturbed
them the second time that day. I left them to
finish their nap. But the possum was served for
dinner the following evening&mdash;for this, too, is
strictly in accord with his time-for-all-things
philosophy.</p>

<p>This pair of owls were most persistent in their
attachment to the apple-tree. Several times in
the course of the winter I found them sleeping
soundly in this same deep cavity, making their
winter lodgings in the bent, tumble-down shanty
which, standing not far from the woods and between
the uplands and meadows, has been home,
hotel, post-office, city of refuge, and lookout for
many of the wild folk about the fields.</p>

<p>A worn-out, gone-to-holes orchard is a very
city of hollows-loving animals. Not far away is
one such orchard with a side bordering an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
extensive copse. Where the orchard and copse
meet is an apple-tree that has been the ancestral
home of unnumbered generations of flying-squirrels.
The cavity was first hollowed out by
flickers. The squirrels were interlopers. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the young come in
April the large opening
is stuffed with shredded
chestnut bark, leaving
barely room enough
for the parents to
squeeze through. The
sharpest-eyed hawk
awing would never
dream of waiting outside
that insignificant
door for a meal of
squirrel.</p>

<p>But such precautions
are not always
proof against boys. I
robbed that home one
spring of its entire
batch of babies (no
one with any love of
wild things could resist
the temptation to kidnap
young flying-squirrels), and tried
to bring them up in domestic ways.
But somehow I never succeeded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
pets. Something always happened. One of
these four squirrels was rocked on, a second
was squeezed in a door, a third fell before he
could fly, and the fourth I took to college with
me. He had perfect liberty, for I had no other
room-mate. I set aside one hour a day to
putting corks, pens, photographs, and knives
back in their places, for him to tuck away the
next day in one of my shoes or under my pillow.
More than once I have awakened to find
him curled up in my neck or up my sleeve,
the dearest little bedfellow alive. But it was
three stories from my window to the street; and
one day he tried his wings. They were not
equal to the flight. Since then I have left my
wild pets in the woods.</p>

<p>If one wants to know what birds are about,
especially the larger, more cautious species, let
him get under cover near a tall dead oak or
walnut, standing alone in the middle of open
fields. Such a tree is the natural rest and lookout
for every passer. Here come the hawks to
wait and watch; here the sentinel crows are
posted while the flock pilfers corn and plugs
melons; here the flickers and woodpeckers light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
for a quick lunch of grubs, to call for company
or telegraph across the fields on one of the resonant
limbs; here the flocking blackbirds swoop
and settle, making the old tree look as if it had
suddenly leaved out in mourning&mdash;leaves black
and crackling; and here the turkey-buzzards
halt heavily in their gruesomely glorious flight.</p>

<p>With good field-glasses there is no other vantage-ground
for bird study equal to this. Not in
a day's tramp will one see so many birds, and
have such chances to observe them, as in a single
hour, when the sun is rising or setting, in the
neighborhood of some great, gaunt tree that has
died of years or lonesomeness, or been smitten
by a bolt from the summer clouds.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p>Nature's prodigality and parsimony are extremes
farther apart than her east and west.
Why should she be so lavish of interstellar
space, and crowd a drop of stagnant water
so? Why give the wide sea surface to the
petrels, and screw the sea-urchins into the rocks
on Grand Manan? Why scatter in Delaware
Bay a million sturgeon eggs for every one
hatched, while each mite of a paramecium is
cut in two, and wholes made of the halves?
Why leave an entire forest of green, live pines
for a lonesome crow hermitage, and convert the
rottenest old stump into a submerged-tenth tenement?</p>

<p>Part of the answer, at least, is found in nature's
hatred and horror of death. She fiercely
refuses to have any dead. An empty heaven, a
lifeless sea, an uninhabited rock, a dead drop of
water, a dying paramecium, are intolerable and
impossible. She hastens always to give them
life. The succession of strange dwellers to the
decaying trees is an instance of her universal and
endless effort at making matter live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>Such vigilance over the ever-dying is very
comforting&mdash;and marvelous too. Let any indifferent
apple-tree begin to have holes, and the
tree-toads, the bluebirds, and the red squirrels
move in, to fill the empty trunk with new life and
the sapless limbs with fresh fruit. Let any tall,
stray oak along the river start to die at the top,
and straightway a pair of fish-hawks will load
new life upon it. And these other, engrafted
lives, like the graft of a greening upon wild
wood, yield crops more valuable often, and
always more interesting, than come from the
native stock.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no more useless fruit or timber
grown than that of the swamp-gums (<i>Nyssa uniflora</i>)
of the Jersey bottoms. But if we value
trees according to their capacity for cavities,&mdash;the
naturalist has a right to such a scale of valuation,&mdash;then
these gums rank first. The deliberate
purpose of a swamp-gum, through its hundred
years of life, is to grow as big as possible, that
it may hollow out accordingly. They are the
natural home-makers of the swamps that border
the rivers and creeks in southern New Jersey.
What would the coons, the turkey-buzzards, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the owls do without them? The wild bees
believe the gums are especially built for them.
No white-painted hive, with its disappearing
squares, offers half as much safety to these free-booters
of the summer seas as the gums, open-hearted,
thick-walled, and impregnable.</p>

<p>When these trees alone make up the swamp,
there is a roomy, empty, echo-y effect among the
great gray boles, with their high, horizontal
limbs spanned like rafters above, produced by
no other trees I know. It is worth a trip across
the continent to listen, under a clear autumn
moon, to the cry of a coon-dog far away in the
empty halls of such a swamp. To get the true
effect of a barred owl's hooting, one wants to
find the home of a pair in an ancient gum-swamp.
I know such a home, along Cohansey Creek,
where, the neighboring farmer tells me, he has
heard the owls hoot in spring and autumn since
he remembers hearing anything.</p>

<p>I cannot reach around the butt of the tree that
holds the nest. Tapering just a trifle and a
little on the lean, it runs up smooth and round
for twenty feet, where a big bulge occurs, just
above which is the capacious opening to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
owls' cave. There was design in the bulge, or
foresight in the owls' choice; for that excrescence
is the hardest thing to get beyond I ever
climbed up to. But it must be mounted, or the
queerest pair of little dragons ever hatched will
go unseen.</p>

<p>The owls themselves first guided me to the
spot. I was picking my way through this piece
of woods, one April day, when a shadowy something
swung from one high limb to another
overhead, following me. It was the female owl.
Every time she lighted she turned and fixed her
big black eyes hard on me, silent, somber, and
watchful. As I pushed deeper among the gums,
she began to snap her beak and drop closer.
Her excitement grew every moment. I looked
about for the likely tree. The instant I spied
the hole above the bulge, the owl caught the
direction of my eyes, and made a swoop at me
that I thought meant total blindness.</p>

<p>I began to climb. With this the bird lapsed
into the quiet of despair, perched almost in
reach of me, and began to hoot mournfully:
<i>Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo, oo-oo-a!</i> And faint
and far away came back a timid <i>Woo-hoo, woo-a!</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
from her mate, safely hid across
the creek.</p>

<p>The weird, uncanny cry
rolled round under the
roof of limbs, and
seemed to wake a
ghost-owl in every
hollow bole, echoing
and reëchoing as it
called from tree to
tree, to die away
down the dim, deep
vistas of the swamp.
The silent wings, the
snapping beaks, the eery
hoots in the soft gloom of
the great trees, needed the
help of but little imagination
to carry one back to the threshold of an
unhacked world, and embolden its nymphs and
satyrs, that these centuries of science have hunted
into hiding.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 150px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;She turned and
fixed her big black
eyes hard on me.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>I wiggled above the bulge at the risk of life,
and was greeted at the mouth of the cavern with
hisses and beak-snappings from within. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
a raw spring day; snow still lingered in shady
spots. But here, backed against the farther
wall of the cavity, were two young owls, scarcely
a week old, wrapped up like little Eskimos&mdash;tiny
bundles of down that the whitest-toothed
frost could never bite through.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i057.jpg" width="300" height="306" alt="two owls" title="two owls" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Wrapped up like little Eskimos.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Very green babies of all kinds are queer, uncertain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
indescribable creations&mdash;faith generators.
But the greenest, homeliest, unlikeliest,
babiest babes I ever encountered were these two
in the hole. I wish Walt Whitman had seen
them. He would have written a poem. They
defy my powers of portrayal, for they challenge
the whole mob of my normal instincts.</p>

<p>But quite as astonishing as the appearance of
the young owls was the presence beneath their
feet of the head of a half-grown muskrat, the
hind quarters of two frogs, one large meadow-vole,
and parts of four mice, with many other
pieces too small to identify. These all were
fresh&mdash;the <i>crumbs</i> of one night's dinner, the
leavings of <i>one</i> night's catch. If these were the
fragments only, what would be a conservative
estimate of the night's entire catch?</p>

<p>Gilbert White tells of a pair of owls that built
under the eaves of Selborne Church, that he
"minuted" with his "watch for an hour together,"
and found that they returned to the
nest, the one or the other, "about once in every
five minutes" with a mouse or some little beast
for the young. Twelve mice an hour! Suppose
they hunted only two evening hours a day?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
The record at the summer's end is almost beyond
belief.</p>

<p>Not counting what the two old owls ate, and
leaving out of the count the two frogs, it is within
limits to reckon not less than six small animals
brought to the hollow gum every night of the
three weeks that these young owls were dependent
for food&mdash;a riddance in this short time of
not less than one hundred and twenty-five muskrats,
mice, and voles. What four boys in the
same time could clear the meadows of half that
number? And these animals are all harmful,
the muskrats exceedingly so, where the meadows
are made by dikes and embankments.</p>

<p>Not a tree in South Jersey that spring bore a
more profitable crop. When fruit-growing in
Jersey is done for pleasure, the altruistic farmer
with a love for natural history will find large
reward in his orchards of gums, that now are
only swamps.</p>

<p>Just as useful as the crop of owls, and beyond
all calculation in its sweetening effects upon our
village life, is the annual yield of swallows by
the piles in the river. Years ago a high spring
tide carried away the south wing of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
bridge, but left the piles, green and grown over
with moss, standing with their heads just above
flood-tide mark. In the tops of the piles are
holes, bored to pass lines through, or left by
rusted bolts, and eaten wide by waves and wind.
Besides these there are a few genuine excavations
made by erratic woodpeckers. This whole
clump of water-logged piles has been colonized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
by blue-backed tree-swallows, every crack and
cranny wide enough and deep enough to hold a
nest being appropriated for domestic uses by a
pair of the dainty people. It is no longer a
sorry forest of battered, sunken stumps; it is a
swallow-Venice. And no gayer gondoliers ever
glided over wave-paved streets than these swallows
on the river. When the days are longest
the village does its whittling on the new bridge
in the midst of this twittering bird life, watching
the swallows in the sunset skim and flash
among the rotting timbers over the golden-flowing
tide.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i058.jpg" width="400" height="374" alt="sunken stumps" title="sunken stumps" />
<span class="caption">&quot;It is no longer a sorry forest of battered, sunken stumps.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>If I turn from the river toward the woods
again, I find that the fences all the way are
green with vines and a-hum with bumblebees.
Even the finger-board at the cross-roads is a living
pillar of ivy. All is life. There are no dead,
no graveyards anywhere. A nature-made cemetery
does not exist in my locality. Yonder,
where the forest-fire came down and drank of
the river, is a stretch of charred stumps; but
every one is alive with some sort of a tenant.
Not one of these stumps is a tombstone. We
have graves and slabs and names in our burial-place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and nothing more. But there is not so
much as a slab in the fields and woods. When
the telegraph-poles and the piles are cut, the
stumps are immediately prepared for new life,
and soon begin blossoming into successive beds
of mosses and mushrooms, while the birds are
directed to follow the bare poles and make them
live again.</p>

<p>A double line of these pole-specters stretches
along the road in front of my door, holding hands
around the world. I have grown accustomed to
the hum of the wires, and no longer notice the
sound. But one May morning recently there
was a new note in the pole just outside the yard.
I laid my ear to the wood. <i>Pick&mdash;pick&mdash;pick</i>;
then all was still. Again, after a moment's pause,
I heard <i>pick&mdash;pick&mdash;pick</i> on the inside. At my
feet was a scattering of tiny yellow chips. Backing
off a little, I discovered the hole, about the
size of my fist, away up near the cross-bars. It
was not the first time I had found High-hole
laying claim to the property of the telegraph
companies. I stole back and thumped. Instantly
a dangerous bill and a flashing eye appeared, and
High-hole, with his miner's lamp burning red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in the top of his cap
lunged off across the
fields in some ill humor, no doubt.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i059.jpg" width="400" height="402" alt="pillar of ivy" title="pillar of ivy" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Even the finger-board
is a living
pillar of ivy.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Throughout the summer there was telegraphing
with and without wires on that dry, resonant
pole. And meantime, if there was anything unintelligible
in the ciphers at Glasgow or Washington,
it was high-hole talk. For there was reared
inside that pole as large, as noisy, and as red-headed
a family of flickers as ever hatched. What
a brood they were! They must have snarled
the wires and Babelized their talk terribly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>While this robust and uncultured family of
flickers were growing up, only three doors away
(counting by poles) a modest and soft-voiced
pair of bluebirds, with a decently numbered
family of four, were living in a hole so near the
ground that I could look in upon the meek but
brave little mother.</p>

<p>There is still another dead-tree crop that the
average bird-lover and summer naturalist rarely
gathers&mdash;I mean the white-footed mice. They
are the jolliest little beasts in all the tree hollows.
It is when the woods are bare and deep with
snow, when the cold, dead winter makes outside
living impossible, that one really appreciates
the coziness and protection of the life in these
deep rooms, sunk like wells into the hearts of
the trees. With what unconcern the mice await
nightfall and the coming of the storms! They
can know nothing of the anxiety and dread of
the crows; they can share little of the crows'
suffering in the bitter nights of winter. A
warm, safe bed is a large item in out-of-doors
living when it is cold; and I have seen where
these mice tuck themselves away from the dark
and storm in beds so snug and warm that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
wished to be an elf myself, with white feet and
a long tail, to creep in with them.</p>

<p>I had some wood-choppers near the house on
the lookout for mice, but, though they often
marked the stumps where they had cut into
nests, the winter nearly passed before I secured
a single white-foot. Coming up from the pond
one day with a clerical friend, after a vain attempt
to skate, we lost our way in the knee-deep
snow, and while floundering about happened
upon a large dead pine that was new to me. It
was as stark, as naked, and as dead a tree, apparently,
as ever went to dust. The limbs were
broken off a foot or more from the trunk, and
stuck out like stumps of arms; the top had been
drilled through and through by woodpeckers,
and now lay several feet away, buried in the
snow; and the hole, like the limbs, was without
a shred of bark, but covered instead with a thin
coating of slime. This slime was marked with
fine scratches, as would be made by the nails of
very small animals. I almost rudely interrupted
my learned friend's discussion of the documentary
hypothesis with the irreverent exclamation
that there were mice in the old corpse. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Hebrew scholar stared at the tree. Then he
stared at me. Had I gone daft so suddenly?
But I was dropping off my overcoat and ordering
him away to borrow the ax of a man we
heard chopping. He looked utterly undone,
but thought it best to humor me, though I know
he dreaded putting an ax in my hands just then,
and would infinitely rather have substituted his
skates. I insisted, however, and he disappeared
for the ax.</p>

<p>The snow was deep, the pine was punky and
would easily fall; and now was the chance to get
my mice. They were in there, I knew, for those
fine, fresh scratches told of scramblers gone up
to the woodpecker holes since the last storm.</p>

<p>The preacher appeared with the ax. Off came
his coat. He was as eager now as though this
tottering pine were an altar of Baal. He was
anxious, also, to know if I had an extra sense&mdash;a
kind of X-ray organ that saw mice at the centers
of trees. And, priest though he was (shame
on the human animal!), he had grown excited
at the prospect of the chase of&mdash;mice!</p>

<p>I tramped away the snow about the tree. The
ax was swinging swiftly through the air; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
preacher was repeating between strokes: "<i>I'm&mdash;truly&mdash;sorry&mdash;man's&mdash;dominion&mdash;has&mdash;</i>"
when
suddenly there was a crunch, a crash, and the
axman leaped aside with the yell of a fiend; for,
as the tree struck, three tiny, brown-backed,
white-footed creatures were dashed into the soft
snow. "The prettiest thing I ever saw," he declared
enthusiastically, as I put into his hand
the only mouse captured.</p>

<p>We traced the chambers up and down the
tree as they wound, stairway-like, just inside
the hard outer shell. Here and there we came
upon garners of acorns and bunches of bird
feathers and shredded bark&mdash;a complete fortress
against the siege of winter.</p>

<p>That pine had not borne a green needle for a
decade. It was too long dead and too much decayed
to have even a fat knot left. Yet there
was not a livelier, more interesting tree in the
region that winter, nor one half so full of goings
on, as this same old shell of a pine, with scarcely
heart enough to stand.</p>

<h2><a name="IN_THE_OCTOBER_MOON" id="IN_THE_OCTOBER_MOON"></a>IN THE OCTOBER MOON</h2>

<p>An October night, calm, crisp, and moonlit!
There is a delicate aroma from the falling
leaves in the air, as sweet as the scent of fresh-filled
haymows. The woods are silent, shadowy,
and sleepful, lighted dimly by the moon, as a
vague, happy dream lights the dark valley of our
sleep. Dreamful is this night world, but yet not
dreaming. When, in the highest noon, did every
leaf, every breeze, seem so much a self, so full of
ready life? The very twigs that lie brittle and
dead beneath our feet seem wakeful now and on
the alert. In this silence we feel myriad movings
everywhere; and we know that this sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
is but the sleep of the bivouac fires, that an army
is breaking camp to move under cover of the
night. Every wild thing that knows the dark
will be stirring to-night. And what softest foot
can fall without waking the woods?</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Heaped in the hollows of the grove, the autumn leaves lie dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit's tread.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Not a mouse can scurry, not a chestnut drop,
not a wind whisper among these new-fallen
leaves without discovery; even a weasel cannot
dart across the moon-washed path and not leave
a streak of brown upon the silver, plain enough
to follow.</p>

<p>A morning in May is best of all the year to be
afield with the birds; but to watch for the wild
four-footed things, a moonlight night in October
is the choice of the seasons. May-time is bird-time.
That is their spring of mate-winning and
nest-building, and it bubbles over with life and
song. The birds are ardent lovers; they sometimes
fight in their wooing: but fighting or singing,
they are frank, happy creatures, and always
willing to see you. The mammals are just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
ardent lovers as the birds, and infinitely more
serious. But they are not poets; they are not
in the show business; and they want no outsider
to come and listen to their pretty story of
woe. Their spring, their courting-time, is not a
time of song and play. The love-affairs of a
timid, soulful-eyed rabbit are so charged and intense
as not always to be free from tragedy.
Don't expect any attention in the spring, even
from that bunch of consuming curiosity, the red
squirrel; he has something in hand, for once,
more to his mind than quizzing you. Life with
the animals then, and through the summer, has
too much of love and fight and fury, is too
terribly earnest, to admit of any frolic.</p>

<p>But autumn brings release from most of these
struggles. There is surcease of love; there is
abundance of food; and now the only passions
of the furry breasts are such gentle desires as
abide with the curious and the lovers of peace
and plenty. The animals are now engrossed
with the task of growing fat and furry.
Troubled with no higher ambitions, curiosity,
sociability, and a thirst for adventure begin to
work within them these long autumn nights,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and not one of them, however wild and fearful,
can resist his bent to prowl in the light of the
October moon.</p>

<p>To know much of the wild animals at home
one must live near their haunts, with eyes and
ears open, forever on the watch. For you must
wait their pleasure. You cannot entreat them
for the sake of science, nor force them in the
name of the law. You cannot set up your easel
in the meadow, and hire a mink or muskrat to
pose for you any time you wish; neither can
you call, when you like, at the hollow gum in
the swamp and interview a coon. The animals
flatly refuse to sit for their pictures, and to see
reporters and assessors. But carry your sketch-book
and pad with you, and, after a while, in
the most unlikely times and places, the wariest
will give you sittings for a finished picture, and
the most reticent will tell you nearly all that
he knows.</p>

<p>At no time of the year are the animals so
loquacious, so easy of approach, as along in the
October nights. There is little to be seen of
them by day. They are cautious folk. By nature
most of them are nocturnal; and when this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
habit is not inherited, fear has led to its acquisition.
But protected by the dark, the shy and
suspicious creep out of their hiding-places; they
travel along the foot-paths, they play in the
wagon-roads, they feed in our gardens, and I
have known them to help themselves from our
chicken-coops. If one has never haunted the
fields and woods at night he little knows their
multitude of wild life. Many a hollow stump
and uninteresting hole in the ground&mdash;tombs
by day&mdash;give up their dead at night, and something
more than ghostly shades come forth.</p>

<p>If one's pulse quickens at the sight and sound
of wild things stirring, and he has never seen,
in the deepening dusk, a long, sniffling snout
poked slowly out of a hollow chestnut, the glint
of black, beady eyes, the twitch of papery ears,
then a heavy-bodied possum issue from the hole,
clasping the edge with its tail, to gaze calmly
about before lumbering off among the shadows&mdash;then
he still has something to go into the
woods for.</p>

<p>Our forests by daylight are rapidly being
thinned into picnic groves; the bears and panthers
have disappeared, and by day there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
nothing to fear, nothing to give our imaginations
exercise. But the night remains, and if we
hunger for adventure, why, besides the night,
here is the skunk; and the two offer a pretty
sure chance for excitement. Never to have
stood face to face in a narrow path at night
with a full-grown, leisurely skunk is to have
missed excitement and suspense second only to
the staring out of countenance of a green-eyed
wildcat. It is surely worth while, in these days
of parks and chipmunks, when all stir and adventure
has fled the woods, to sally out at night
for the mere sake of meeting a skunk, for the
shock of standing before a beast that will not
give you the path. As you back away from
him you feel as if you were really escaping. If
there is any genuine adventure left for us in
this age of suburbs, we must be helped to it by
the dark.</p>

<p>Who ever had a good look at a muskrat in
the glare of day? I was drifting noiselessly
down the river, recently, when one started to
cross just ahead of my boat. He got near
midstream, recognized me, and went under like
a flash. Even a glimpse like this cannot be had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
every summer; but in the autumn nights you
cannot hide about their houses and fail to see
them. In October they are building their winter
lodges, and the clumsiest watcher may spy
them glistening in the moonlight as they climb
with loads of sedge and mud to the roofs of their
sugar-loaf houses. They are readily seen, too,
making short excursions into the meadows; and
occasionally the desire to rove and see the world
will take such hold upon one as to drive him a
mile from water, and he will slink along in the
shadow of the fences and explore your dooryard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and premises. Frequently, in the late winter, I
have followed their tracks on these night journeys
through the snow between ponds more
than a mile apart.</p>

<p>But there is larger game abroad than muskrats
and possums. These October nights the
quail are in covey, the mice are alive in the dry
grass, and the foxes are abroad. Lying along
the favorite run of Reynard, you <i>may</i> see him.
There are many sections of the country where
the rocks and mountains and wide areas of
sterile pine-land still afford the foxes safe
homes; but in most localities Reynard is rapidly
becoming a name, a creature of fables and folk-lore
only. The rare sight of his clean, sharp
track in the dust, or in the mud along the
margin of the pond, adds flavor to a whole
day's tramping; and the glimpse of one in the
moonlight, trotting along a cow-path or lying
low for Br'er Rabbit, is worth many nights of
watching.</p>

<p>I wish the game-laws could be amended to
cover every wild animal left to us. In spite of
laws they are destined to disappear; but if the
fox, weasel, mink, and skunk, the hawks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
owls, were protected as the quail and deer are,
they might be preserved a long time to our
meadows and woods. How irreparable the loss
to our landscape is the extinction of the great
golden eagle! How much less of spirit, daring,
courage, and life come to us since we no longer
mark the majestic creature soaring among the
clouds, the monarch of the skies! A dreary
world it will be out of doors when we can hear
no more the scream of the hawks, can no
longer find the tracks of the coon, nor follow
a fox to den. We can well afford to part with
a turnip, a chicken, and even with a suit of
clothes, now and then, for the sake of this wild
flavor to our fenced pastures and close-cut
meadows.</p>

<p>I ought to have named the crow in the list
deserving protection. He steals. So did Falstaff.
But I should miss Falstaff had Shakspere
left him out; yet no more than I should miss
the crow were he driven from the pines. They
are both very human. Jim Crow is the humanest
bird in feathers. The skunk I did include in
the list. It was not by mistake. The skunk
has a good and safe side to him, when we know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">&nbsp;</a></span>
how to approach him. The skunk wants a
champion. Some one ought to spend an entire
October moon with him and give us the better
side of his character. If some one would take
the trouble to get well acquainted with him at
home, it might transpire that we have grievously
abused and avoided him.</p>

<p>There is promise of a future for the birds in
their friendship for us and in our interest and
sentiment for them. Everybody is interested in
birds; everybody loves them. There are bird-books
and bird-books and bird-books&mdash;new volumes
in every publisher's spring announcements.
Every one with wood ways knows the songs and
nests of the more common species. But this is
not so with the four-footed animals. They are
fewer, shyer, more difficult of study. Only a
few of us are enthusiastic enough to back into a
hole in a sand-bank and watch all night for the
"beasts" with dear old Tam Edwards.</p>

<p>But such nights of watching, when every fallen
leaf is a sentinel and every moonbeam a spy, will
let us into some secrets about the ponds and fields
that the sun, old and all-seeing as he is, will
never know. Our eyes were made for daylight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
but I think if the anatomists tried they might
find the rudiments of a third, a night eye, behind
the other two. From my boyhood I certainly
have seen more things at night than the brightest
day ever knew of. If our eyes were intended
for day use, our other senses seem to work best
by night. Do we not take the deepest impressions
when the plates of these sharpened senses
are exposed in the dark? Even in moonlight
our eyes are blundering things; but our hearing,
smell, and touch are so quickened by the alertness
of night that, with a little training, the
imagination quite takes the place of sight&mdash;a
new sense, swift and vivid, that adds an excitement
and freshness to the pleasure of out-of-door
study, impossible to get through our two
straightforward, honest day eyes.</p>

<p>Albeit, let us stay at home and sleep when
there is no moon; and even when she climbs up
big and round and bright, there is no surety of
a fruitful excursion before the frosts fall. In
the summer the animals are worn with home
cares and doubly wary for their young; the grass
is high, the trees dark, and the yielding green is
silent under even so clumsy a crawler as the box-turtle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
But by October the hum of insects is
stilled, the meadows are mown, the trees and
bushes are getting bare, the moon pours in unhindered,
and the crisp leaves crackle and rustle
under the softest-padded foot.</p>
